The startup's valuation before the funding round comes to $18.4 billion, the source added. Anthropic, co-founded by siblings and former executives at Microsoft-backed rival OpenAI Dario and Daniela Amodei, has shown efforts to secure the resources and deep-pocketed backers needed to compete with OpenAI and be leaders in the technology sector.

https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-3-stocks-had-a-massive-2023-how-does-2024-look-for-them-200644585,,"AI integrated into social, with a pinch of cruising; three stocks remain a ""strong buy"" for good reasons.
Investing in stocks has become the mainstay of US economic life to avoid wealth erosion via inflation. The Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) reported record-high stock ownership in 2022, at 58% compared to the previous all-time high of 53% just before the Global Financial Crisis.
The S&P 500 (SPX) market benchmark is heading to topple its all-time high of 4796.56 on January 3, 2022. Following multiple FOMC signals that the interest rate hiking cycle is ending after another pause, SPX is now holding 24.32% gains at 4758.50.
At 74.89% probability, fed fund futures are pricing the first rate cut for March 2024. With cheaper debt financing on the horizon, the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) Index already reached a new all-time high this Tuesday. Outside of big companies under the S&P 500 umbrella, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) reached 302% gains YTD, riding on the Bitcoin bull run.
Inside the S&P 500 umbrella, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has shown the best performance at 243%, followed by Meta (NASDAQ:META) at 182% and Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) at 152%. The most popular stocks, from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have all received more modest 50% – 80% gains year-to-date.
The question is, are SPX high-gainers this year poised for low-selling in 2024?
1. Nvidia
In 2023, Nvidia crossed a definitive transition from a GPU company focused on the video gaming market to a data center supplier focused on generative AI demand. In the latest Q3 earnings report, Nvidia generated $18.12 billion in revenue, up 205% from $5.93 billion in a year-ago quarter.
Having beaten estimated earnings per share (EPS) of $3.09 at $3.71 for the quarter, Nvidia’s Data Center segment grew by 279% year-over-year to $14.51 billion. In contrast, the company’s long-standing bread and butter, the Gaming segment, tracked 81% yoy growth to $2.86 billion.
Nonetheless, both global markets are poised for double-digit growth. The data center market is poised to reach $554.4 billion in 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 -13%. Likewise, the gaming sector will reach $610.6 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 10.5%.
In both sectors, Nvidia’s dominance is strong, having an 87% foothold in the discrete GPU market. As the key supplier of GPUs for Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and others, Nvidia is set to carry on AI workload demand into 2024. Although USG chip export controls to China have curbed Nvidia’s A800, H800, A100, H100, and L40S chips, its competitors Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have also been impacted.
Taking this into account, Nvidia’s revenue outlook for Q4 FY2024 is $20 billion (+/- 2%). In other words, Nvidia is navigating to achieve AI data center dominance, just as it achieved it in the video gaming arena. This market is heading for a $667.96 billion size by 2030, with a CAGR of 47.5%.
Altogether, Nvidia is a rare case of being both a blue chip and a high-growth stock while still likely to deliver high returns despite already triple-digit gains. Based on 38 analyst inputs pulled by Nasdaq, NVDA is a “strong buy.” The average NVDA price target is $661.35 vs current $491. The high estimate is $1100, while the low forecast is $560.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta is another story of market cornering. Having spread out with Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp platforms, Meta is pursuing the momentum of absorbing small startups. Against all competitors, Meta expanded its market share in Q3 2023, now at 16.86% (by total revenue).
Due to this momentum, Meta’s net income for the quarter grew 163% yoy, significantly greater than the sector’s growth of 56%. The social media giant is heavily onboarding the AI train, having co-launched AI Alliance with IBM (NYSE:IBM) this December.
Having access to leading developers and academics in the AI field, Meta is setting itself up for greater cost-efficiency in ad delivery. This is already visible from Meta’s Q3 earnings report, showing a 40% operating margin, a double improvement from 20% in a year-ago quarter.
As Meta Platform demonstrated that it generates more revenue from operations, 41 analysts pulled by Nasdaq placed META stock as a “strong buy.” The average META price target is $387.35 vs the current $350. The high estimate is $435, while the low forecast is $345.
3. Royal Caribbean Cruises
Following the lockdowns in early 2020, the cruise industry was in shambles. Alongside the stock collapse of cruise companies, some shut down permanently. Cruise & Maritime Voyages and Pullmantur were just some that had been sold, scrapped, or returned to the Royal Caribbean Group.
Royal Caribbean emerged as a consolidated company from this crisis, second only to the Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL), with a 33.11% market share. In turn, the company’s 153% stock performance in 2023 is buying on weakness as Royal lifts from the bottom.
In the Q3 earnings report, Royal reported better results than guidance at $3.65 earnings per share. The company’s restructuring worked, increasing gross margin yields and net yield at 19.1% and 16.7%, respectively vs Q3 2019.
With customer deposits pooled to $5 billion, Royal forecasts greater demand in 2024, outpacing 2019 levels. Accordingly, 18 analyst inputs pulled by Nasdaq place RCL stock as a “strong buy.” The average RCL price target is $129 vs current $123. The high estimate is $148, while the low forecast is $100 per share.

https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-bandwagon-bias-should-you-ditch-the-2023-hits-for-2024s-breakout-stars-200644551,,"As investors cheer on the Magnificent 7, some football fans are forging new allegiances in hopes of rooting for the coming Super Bowl champion. The task isn’t easy.
Recent favorites like the Bills and Bengals are fighting to make the playoffs. Indeed, a few fans of those teams will jump on the recently popular Dolphins or Lions bandwagon. Others may stick with the dependable Eagles, Chiefs, and Forty Niners.
Stock market investors and football fans are not that different. As 2023 ends, professional and amateur investors start thinking about what stock or investment theme bandwagon to jump on for the coming year.
This year, the Magnificent 7 stocks are the odds-on favorites to win the stock market Super Bowl. While hats off to those profiting from the Magnificent 7, we must look ahead. To do so, we must appreciate the bandwagon bias harbored in our mindsets and not let it cloud our vision of the future.Bandwagon Bias Of 2023Bandwagon bias is a psychological phenomenon that happens when people do something because others are doing it already. Often called following the herd in market parlance, the bandwagon bias forces many investors into decisions they ultimately regret.
This year’s most popular investment bandwagon is the Magnificent 7, comprised of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta (NASDAQ:META).
The graphs below, courtesy of Goldman Sachs, and our table show these 7 stocks gained 71% this year to date, while the remaining 493 stocks added a mere 6%. The outperformance pushed up their contribution to the S&P 500 to nearly 30%. Lastly, the sharp increase in stock prices led to even more extreme valuations for the group.
Goldman Sachs - Magnificent 7 vs The MarketMagnificent 7-Valuations
The Magnificent 7 are fundamentally stronger companies than the aggregate of the S&P 500. Per Goldman Sachs, revenues for the Magnificent 7 are expected to grow by 8% more than the S&P 500. At the same time, net margins are forecasted to be around 21% for the next two years. Such is double the S&P 500.
Is their share price outperformance justified? Yes. However, if the prices outperform their fundamentals, as may likely be the case, it will now be much harder for a repeat performance in 2024.Nvidia Vs. Albemarle To help appreciate what may lie ahead, we compare Nvidia to Albemarle (NYSE:ALB). Nvidia is up 230% year to date. As a result of the stock surge, Nvidia’s investors are paying a 250% premium for Nvidia’s earnings versus those of the S&P 500.
Nvidia’s earnings will undoubtedly grow faster than the market for a while, but by how much and for how long? Can they avoid competition and margin pressures while keeping sales elevated long enough to justify the premium?
The world’s largest lithium producer is in quite the opposite shoes. Despite strong demand for lithium from electric vehicles (EV) and a projected shortfall of lithium to meet growing EV needs, Albemarle investors only demand a price to earnings of five, about one-fifth of the S&P 500. Its shares are down about 30% year to date.
Despite the significant value in Albemarle compared to Nvidia, investors continue to chase Nvidia and sell Albemarle. Comparing them does not endorse owning Albemarle or selling Nvidia, but they show how markets can be very inefficient.Narratives Drive MarketsAs we highlight with Nvidia and Albemarle, in the short run, narratives and bandwagons of investors drive individual stocks and markets, regardless of whether the narrative makes sense.
Only a few months ago, the popular narrative in the bond market warned that massive U.S. Treasury issuance was responsible for pushing yields higher. Well, such issuance has continued unabated, but yields have fallen precipitously.
Despite the reality of the situation, as outlined in Context and Facts Expose Bearish Narratives, the narrative reinforced a growing bandwagon, resulting in higher yields. Today, the narrative and bandwagon are limping along.
Such is the nature of bandwagons. This year, the Magnificent 7 was the bandwagon to be on. It’s easy to assume that what worked in 2023 will work in 2024. That may be the case. Or it may be the case for the first four months. While the narrative is strong, it can fade quickly, like the bond narrative.
Understanding our bias toward owning the Magnificent 7 allows us to make rational decisions when the narrative changes. Lingering on yesterday’s bandwagon can be dangerous. Just ask those short bonds on the Treasury issuance narrative.
Equally important, renting, not owning, a bandwagon allows us to shift to the winning theme more quickly.
For example, since early November, small-cap stocks have handily beat the S&P 500 and Magnificent 7. These stocks are interest rate sensitive. Ergo, the more dovish Fed stance should help these relatively beaten-down stocks more than the less interest rate-sensitive large-cap stocks. Small-cap stocks may or may not be the winning bandwagon for 2024.SummaryThe graphic below shows that the Super Bowl tends to have different teams vying for the trophy each year. Some helmets appear more often than others, but there are few consecutive champions. Super Bowl Winners
Such is like investing. The Callan Periodic Table of Investment Returns below ranks investment performance by year for key indices. As you will notice, there is no predominant winner year in and year out.
Callan Periodic Table Of Investment Returns
Bandwagon bias can be good as riding the hot theme or group of stocks helps investors grow their wealth. Unfortunately, jumping on a market bandwagon too late can come with steep costs.
As we enter 2024, be open to the possibility that last year’s winners will not take the crown this year.
We don’t know what will replace the Magnificent 7 or when, but we will be sure to keep our bias in check and stay open to new ideas.",0.9992

There was a little bit of something for both the doves and hawks in Tuesday’s U.S. CPI report, which showed that headline inflation continues to slow, but core prices remain sticky.
The consumer price index edged up 0.1% last month after being unchanged in October, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
In the 12 months through November, the annual CPI increased 3.1%, slowing from the 3.2% pace seen in October.
CPI Inflation Data
Economists polled by Investing.com had forecast the CPI would be unchanged for the month and rise 3.1% on a year-on-year basis.
As can be seen in the chart below, U.S. inflation has come down significantly since June 2022, when it peaked at a 40-year high of 9.1%, amid the Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking cycle.CPI Y/Y
Nonetheless, while the rate of inflation is declining, prices are still rising far more quickly than what the Fed would consider consistent with its 2% target range.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, core CPI increased 0.3% in November after climbing 0.2% in the previous month.
On an annual basis, core CPI rose 4.0% after advancing at the same rate in October. Both readings were in line with estimates.
Core CPI Y/Y
In a worrying sign, the so-called ‘supercore inflation’, which tracks the cost of services minus energy and housing, rose 0.44% on the month, doubling from 0.22% in October.
The ‘supercore’ figure is closely watched by Fed officials who believe that it provides a more accurate assessment of the future direction of inflation.
All in all, these numbers suggest that the Fed would still need to see further progress on some of these underlying inflation measures before policymakers are comfortable cutting interest rates.
Taking that into consideration, the Fed’s inflation battle is far from over as sticky underlying core inflation persists, providing further evidence that the U.S. central bank was unlikely to pivot to interest rate cuts early next year.All Eyes Turn to the Fed, PowellWith the CPI report out of the way, the market’s focus is now fixated solely on the final Federal Reserve meeting of the year scheduled for later Wednesday.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged for the third consecutive meeting as Fed officials assess recent signs of economic softening.Fed Rate Estimates
After raising borrowing costs by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range since March 2022, many market participants are growing more confident that the Fed’s policy tightening campaign is all but over.
However, I believe there is a risk that Fed Chair Powell could strike a more hawkish tone than expected in his post-meeting news conference given that some underlying measures of inflation remained relatively elevated in November.
As such, Powell is likely to reiterate that the Fed will keep rates higher for longer as he pushes back against market expectations for a rate cut in the first half of 2024.
In addition, watch for the Fed chair to signal that he is not yet ready to definitively rule out further hikes as sticky inflation continues to meander along its slow, downward path.
It should be noted that despite Powell’s repeated ‘higher-for-longer’ rate warnings, investors have largely ignored him for the most part amid the belief the Fed is unlikely to raise rates any further and have started to price in a series of rate cuts beginning next spring.
As per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool, there is a roughly 45% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's March 2024 meeting, while odds for May stand at about 75%.
I think that a rate cut would likely only come in either June or September of next year as inflation takes longer to return to the Fed's 2% target than many had hoped.
As such, the central bank could keep policy rates in restrictive territory for longer than markets currently anticipate.What To Do NowWall Street’s major averages closed at fresh highs for the year on Tuesday, as investors reacted to the latest inflation report while awaiting the Fed’s last policy decision of 2023.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrials Average closed at its highest level since January 4, 2022, and now stands less than 1% away from its all-time high.
Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 ended at its best level since Jan. 14, 2022, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite at its highest since March 29, 2022.
S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq Charts
While I am currently long on the Dow, S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the Dow Jones ETF (NYSE:DIA), S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), and the QQQ, I have been cautious about making new purchases due to signals the market is overbought.
Perhaps my biggest worry is the total lack of market fear as represented by the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX. As seen in the chart below, the market fear gauge tumbled to its lowest level since January 2020 on Tuesday.VIX Chart
When the market fear gauge gets unusually low, it's a sign of excessive bullishness or complacency. That raises the risk of a market pullback.

Russia has been at loggerheads with foreign technology companies over content, censorship, data and local representation in a simmering dispute that intensified after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The RIA news agency said the fine had also been imposed due to Google failing to remove ""extremist content"" and the distribution of what Russia calls ""LGBT propaganda"".  Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Russia calls the conflict in Ukraine a ""special military operation"". Russia's Supreme Court ruled in November that LGBT activists should be designated as ""extremists"" in a move that representatives of gay and transgender people fear will lead to arrests and prosecutions. 
Alphabet's YouTube has been a particular target of the Russian state's ire but, unlike Twitter and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)' Facebook and Instagram, it has not been blocked. The fine was calculated as a share of Google's annual turnover in Russia. The company was handed similar turnover-based penalties of 7.2 billion roubles in late 2021 and 21.1 billion roubles in August 2022. ($1 = 90.4825 roubles)",0.0312

The FTC said in a notice of proposed rule-making that it was considering changing the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule to put more restrictions on when and how companies could monetize children's data. It would also limit how companies can use notifications to nudge children to stay online. The rule affects companies which collect personal information about users under age 13. ""Kids must be able to play and learn online without being endlessly tracked by companies looking to hoard and monetize their personal data,"" said FTC Chair Lina Khan in a statement. ""The proposed changes to COPPA are much-needed, especially in an era where online tools are essential for navigating daily life."" Since many platforms and websites on the internet are free, companies rely on advertising to pay bills. They try to tailor that advertising by using information about users which indicate what they might be interested in. Critics have accused the platforms of failing to address mental health harms done by algorithms used by the platforms to keep young people engaged. Under the proposed changes, companies would have to get ""separate verifiable parental consent"" to share most information about children with advertisers and other third parties.  The proposed changes would reinforce that companies cannot ban children from an activity if they decline to allow collection of personal data and would allow school districts to bar companies that provide educational technology for using any information it collects for a commercial purpose. The FTC said that it would accept comments on the rule for 60 days. Neither Alphabet nor Meta (NASDAQ:META) immediately responded to a request for comment.",0.954
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/google-to-pay-700-million-to-us-consumers-states-in-play-store-settlement-3259441,"Dec 18, 2023","By Mike Scarcella (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will pay $700 million and revamp its Play app store to allow for greater competition as part of an antitrust settlement with U.S. states and consumers, according to the company and filings in San Francisco federal court on Monday. Google will pay $630 million into a settlement fund for consumers and $70 million into a fund that will be used by states, according to the settlement, which still requires a judge's final approval. The settlement said eligible consumers will receive at least $2 and may get additional payments based on their spending on Google Play between Aug. 16, 2016 and Sept. 30, 2023. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, joined the settlement. Google was accused of overcharging consumers through unlawful restrictions on the distribution of apps on Android devices and unnecessary fees for in-app transactions. It did not admit wrongdoing. Attorneys for the states and consumers announced the settlement in September, but the terms were kept confidential ahead of Google's related trial with ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games. A California federal jury last week agreed with Epic that parts of Google's app business were anticompetitive. Wilson White, Google vice president for government affairs and public policy, in a statement said the settlement ""builds on Android's choice and flexibility, maintains strong security protections, and retains Google's ability to compete with other (operating system) makers, and invest in the Android ecosystem for users and developers."" The company said it was expanding the ability of app and game developers to provide consumers an alternative billing option for in-app purchases next to Play's billing system. Google said it had piloted ""choice billing"" in the U.S. for more than a year. As part of the settlement, Google said it would simplify users' ability to download apps directly from developers. California, North Carolina, New York, Tennessee and Utah led the states' coalition. State regulators spent hundreds of hours negotiating the settlement, Monday's court filing said. Democratic North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein told Reuters on Tuesday that “the changes Google is required to adopt will result in more innovation among app developers and lower prices for consumers, and that was always our number one goal.” The states' attorneys said ""no other U.S. antitrust enforcer has yet been able to secure remedies of this magnitude from Google"" or another major digital platform. Epic sued for an injunction, but not money damages, and the company next year is expected to make its own proposal to the judge hearing the cases, U.S. District Judge James Donato, about potential changes to Google's Play store. In a statement, Epic public policy head Corie Wright said the states' settlement ""did not address the core of Google’s unlawful and anticompetitive behavior."" Wright said Epic will press at the next phase of its trial ""to truly open up the Android ecosystem."" 
Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, in a post on social media platform X, said the states could have won a larger damages amount ""if they'd stayed in the fight a few weeks longer.""

The restrictions are set to be enforced by early 2024, the company said. Aside from the U.S., a slew of groundbreaking elections are expected in 2024, including national elections in India, the world's largest democracy, and South Africa, among others.  The tech giant said it will ""work with an increased focus on the role artificial intelligence (AI) might play"" as it looks to service voters and campaigns related to these elections. Facebook-owner Meta had also said in November it is barring political campaigns and advertisers in other regulated industries from using its new generative AI advertising products. Advertisers on Meta will also have to disclose when artificial intelligence (AI) or other digital methods are used to alter or create political, social or election related advertisements on Facebook (NASDAQ:META) and Instagram. On the other hand, Elon Musk's social media platform X, which is being probed by the European Union, said in August it would now allow political advertising in the U.S. from candidates and political parties. It will also expand its safety and elections team ahead of the U.S. election.  All political ads had previously been banned globally on X since 2019.  
Governments across the globe have been rallying to regulate AI in light of the threats it poses, such as the spread of misinformation.  Big Tech firms will face new European Union rules to clearly label political advertising on their platforms, who paid for it and how much and which elections are being targeted.",0.9403

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/an-abused-wife-took-on-tesla-over-tracking-tech-she-lost-3260043,"Dec 19, 2023","By Kristina Cooke and Dan Levine (Reuters) - San Francisco police Sergeant David Radford contacted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in May 2020 with a request on a case: Could the automaker provide data on an alleged stalker’s remote access to a vehicle? A woman had come into the station visibly shaken, according to a police report. She told police that her abusive husband, in violation of a restraining order, was stalking and harassing her using the technology in their 2016 Tesla Model X. The SUV allows owners to remotely access its location and control other features through a smartphone app. She told police she had discovered a metal baseball bat in the back seat — the same bat the husband had previously used to threaten her, the police report stated. Weeks later, Sergeant Radford asked Tesla for data that might help the investigation. A Tesla service manager replied that remote-access logs were only available within seven days of the events recorded, according to records in a lawsuit the woman later filed. Radford’s investigation stalled. Cases of technology-enabled stalking involving cars are emerging as automakers add ever-more-sophisticated features, such as location tracking and remote control of functions such as locking doors or honking the horn, according to interviews with divorce lawyers, private investigators and anti-domestic-violence advocates. Such abusive behavior using other devices, such as phone spyware or tracking devices, has long been a concern, prompting technology companies including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to design safeguards into their products. Reuters examined the details of the San Francisco case and another one involving alleged stalking through Tesla technology but could not quantify the scope of such abuse. Tesla has encountered at least one other case of stalking through its vehicle app, according to a Tesla employee’s testimony in the San Francisco woman’s lawsuit. Some attorneys, private investigators and anti-abuse advocates said in interviews that they knew of similar cases but declined to provide details, citing privacy and security concerns. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Radford and the San Francisco Police Department did not comment on the investigation. The San Francisco case offers insight into the complex considerations these technologies pose for auto companies and law enforcement. Other automakers offer similar tracking and remote-access features, and an industry group has acknowledged the need for protections to ensure car technology doesn’t become a tool for abuse. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI), a technology-focused trade group for automakers and suppliers, in 2021 cited spousal violence as a reason why California regulators should not require carmakers to release location or other personal data in most cases under a new state privacy law. The law sought to give consumers broadly the right to access their personal data being tracked by companies. The auto group argued some car owners might improperly request personal data on other drivers of the same vehicle. Disclosing location-tracking data to an abuser could create “the potential for significant harm,” wrote the AAI. The group’s membership includes many major automakers, but not Tesla. Some automakers have taken steps to prevent the misuse of data their vehicles track. General Motors (NYSE:GM) spokesperson Kelly Cusinato said GM’s OnStar mobile system allows all drivers to mask their location, even if they are not the vehicle’s owner or primary user. Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), which makes electric trucks and SUVs, is working on a similar function, said Wassym Bensaid, senior vice president of software development. Rivian hasn’t encountered a case of domestic abuse through its vehicle technology, according to Bensaid, but believes “users should have a right to control where that information goes.”  GM declined to comment on whether its technology had been involved in any alleged domestic abuse. REQUEST DENIED The San Francisco woman sued her husband in state Superior Court in 2020 on claims including assault and sexual battery. She later named Tesla as a defendant, accusing the automaker of negligence for continuing to provide the husband access to the car despite the restraining order against him. Her lawsuit sought monetary damages from Tesla. The woman, at her request, is identified in court papers only by her initials; she cited a risk of physical harm. Her husband is also identified only by his initials. Reuters reviewed court filings, police reports, depositions, company emails and other documents in the case, which has not been previously reported. The woman made multiple requests to Tesla in writing and in person, according to her lawsuit, seeking remote data logs and asking Tesla to disable her husband’s account. The requests started in 2018, more than a year before Radford, the police investigator, sought data from Tesla. Tesla told the woman that it could not remove her husband’s access to the car’s technology because his name remained on the vehicle’s title as a co-owner, along with hers, according to records she filed in her lawsuit. Tesla prevailed in the lawsuit. After denying the San Francisco police request for evidence, the automaker argued she had no proof that her husband used the car’s features to stalk her. Tesla also argued the restraining order against the woman’s husband never specifically ordered the automaker to act. The woman and her husband settled the lawsuit in 2023 on undisclosed terms. Their divorce case is pending. The restraining order against the husband remains in effect. The husband, in a deposition, denied tracking or harassing his wife through the vehicle’s technology. His attorney declined to comment. In a separate case, Renée Izambard said in an interview that her then-husband was tracking her on his Tesla app after he made comments to her indicating he knew where she had been. Izambard filed for divorce from her husband in 2018 and alleged years of physical and psychological abuse. Izambard said in an interview her ex-husband’s tracking of her through the vehicle was “just one part of a much wider pattern of coercive control.” Her ex-husband and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.  Unlike the San Francisco woman, Izambard had her own access to change the account settings and turn off its connection to the internet, so she did not have to interact with Tesla, she said. Tesla cars allow a primary account holder to add additional drivers who can access the car’s features and settings – or the primary user can deny other drivers that access, according to the San Francisco woman’s lawsuit. She complained in court records that the company only allowed one primary account holder even in cases like hers, where two people co-owned the vehicle.  NO POLICY Long before the latest automotive features enabled stalking, abusers used other technology on smartphones or tracking devices, said Jeff Kaplan, a private investigator. Apple launched its AirTag location-tracking device in 2021 as a way to help people find lost purses or keys. The small tags can easily be concealed in a car’s interior or other locations, and soon became a favorite tool for one partner to track another. “I’m getting those all the time,” Kaplan said. Earlier this year, Apple and Google jointly proposed standardized technology that could be adopted by any tech company that would allow for alerting people who are being tracked without their knowledge through tags or smartphone features. The idea, presented to a tech-industry standards organization, won praise from some anti-domestic abuse advocates. Apple and Google did not comment for this story. In the San Francisco case, Tesla said in response to a plaintiff’s written request for information that it “does not have a specific companywide policy” regarding how to handle stalking allegations involving its vehicles’ technology. Stalkers always find a way to use location data, making this problem “totally foreseeable,” said Catherine Crump, a Berkeley Law School professor specializing in privacy issues involving technology. “It is disappointing that a company as sophisticated and well-resourced as Tesla doesn’t have better answers to this,” said Crump, who is also a former adviser to the White House Domestic Policy Council. BAT (LON:BATS) IN THE VEHICLE When the San Francisco woman and her husband bought the Tesla Model X in January 2016, he set himself up as the administrator on the account and listed her as an additional driver, her lawsuit said. That meant she could not remove his access without his password. After they separated in August 2018, a family law judge found she had suffered repeated physical abuse during the marriage, which the husband acknowledged, as well as sexual abuse, which he denied, court records show. The judge found her version of events credible and his “less credible.” Over the next several months, the woman alleged, she regularly returned to the car to find that its settings and features appeared to have been manipulated. She found the doors open, the suspension settings changed, and the vehicle’s ability to charge turned off. When she asked service center employees for help, they tried to disconnect the car from the Internet, but those attempts failed, she said in court records. Two letters, one of them dated in 2018, to Tesla’s legal department by anti-domestic abuse advocates on the woman’s behalf asked the company to preserve data logs and remove the husband’s access. Tesla told the court it could not find these letters in its files. Eventually, a Tesla service center manager contacted Tesla deputy general counsel Ryan McCarthy for advice, the manager said in a deposition reviewed by Reuters. McCarthy said the woman needed to have her husband removed from the vehicle’s title in order for the company to disable his account, the service manager testified. McCarthy did not respond to requests for comment. In its successful defense against the woman’s lawsuit, Tesla cited the husband’s denials and said she had “no proof other than her “belief and imagination” that her husband used the car’s technology to stalk her. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Curtis Karnow agreed with Tesla, writing in a 2022 opinion that both the woman and her husband “had a right” to use the car technology. It is unclear how Tesla was supposed to determine whether her allegations were legitimate, he wrote. 
“A jilted partner might fabricate misuse charges to punish the other,” Karnow wrote, adding that the consequences of imposing liability for car manufacturers “would be broad and incalculable.” In late 2020, the San Francisco woman was allowed by a family court judge to sell the jointly owned Tesla.",-0.999

Under the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), five major U.S. tech companies — Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) — were designated ""gatekeeper"" service providers. From March 2024, these companies — as well as TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance — will be required to make their messaging apps work with rivals and let users choose which ones they want pre-installed on their devices. In a letter seen by Reuters, 21 members of the U.S. House of Representatives warned the new rules could damage American economic and security interests and called on Biden to secure commitments from the EU the rules will be enforced fairly. ""Securing our leadership in this sector is imperative for our economy and American workers,"" the letter said. ""The designation of leading U.S. companies as 'gatekeepers' threatens to upend the U.S. economy, diminish our global leadership in the digital sphere, and jeopardize the security of consumers.""  The European Commission and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Europe is seen by some experts as the global leader in tech regulation. The bloc's DMA and the DSA (Digital Services Act) are attempts at tailoring laws to target the Big Tech companies.  The letter questioned why Chinese companies  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Huawei, and Tencent had avoided designation and why European companies had avoided any scrutiny. ""The EU inexplicably failed to designate any European retailers, content-sharing platforms, payment firms, and telcos,"" it said. Signatories of the letter — including Representative Lou Correa, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Republican, — called on Biden to seek assurances from EU lawmakers the DMA will not be unfairly used to target U.S. companies.  
The U.S. government has previously warned the EU against over-regulating American technology companies. When the DMA was still being drafted, the White House National Security Council told EU representatives that using the bill to solely target American companies would hinder their ability to work together. Since 2021, the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council (TTC) has sought to harmonise technology regulation on either side of the Atlantic, with lawmakers seeking consensus on topics such as supply chain security, export controls and foreign investment.",0.6705

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pro-research-wall-street-dives-into-apples-evolving-landscape-3248951,"Dec 04, 2023","In the dynamic world of technology, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). stands as a beacon of innovation and resilience. Wall Street analysts have been closely monitoring the Cupertino-based giant, dissecting every facet of its operations to forecast the trajectory of its stock amidst a complex competitive and regulatory landscape.Performance in Different MarketsApple's foray into various markets has been a tale of strategic positioning and calculated risks. In China, a key battleground, Apple navigated the competitive tides against local giants like Huawei and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF). Despite a slight decline in unit sales during Singles Day promotions, analysts point to supply constraints rather than a loss of market share as the culprit. Apple's premium pricing strategy, with an average selling price significantly higher than its competitors, has allowed it to capture a substantial portion of market revenue. However, concerns about the product mix in China, with a much lower proportion of higher-end 'Pro' models being sold, could impact revenue.
The termination of the partnership with Goldman Sachs, involving the Apple Card and Savings account offerings, has been a recent blip. Analysts believe that while the financial results have not been significantly impacted, the future could hold a new partnership with different economic terms, possibly less favorable than before.Product Segments and DetailsApple's product ecosystem, from iPhones to Mac computers, has been the core driver of its financial success. The iPhone, in particular, remains a dominant player in high-end Chinese smartphones, with a strong and loyal customer base that supports sustained revenue. However, the competitive landscape is not static, with Huawei's resurgence potentially clawing back some of the market share. The company's inventory levels, which have seen a significant increase above the 5-year median, raise questions about potential overstocking or slowing demand. Yet, analysts argue that these levels are in line with seasonal patterns, indicating managed growth and demand forecasting.Competitive LandscapeThe competitive landscape for Apple is multifaceted. While it has shown resilience against Huawei in China, the potential for market share loss remains if competitors continue to grow aggressively. Supply constraints and a shift in consumer preferences towards lower-end models could also pressure hardware revenues. Additionally, KeyBanc's analysis indicates a below-consensus forecast for F1Q24 Hardware revenue estimates and a month-over-month decline in Indexed Spending, which are seen as negative signs entering the holiday shopping season.Market TrendsMarket trends have been both a boon and a bane for Apple. The company's focus on high-end devices with higher average selling prices has allowed it to earn significant market revenue. However, the overall performance of iPhones has been characterized as underwhelming, with Android sales showing better performance than initially expected. Barclays' analysis indicates that iPhone sales have seen strong year-over-year growth, up by 8 million units for September-October, likely driven by sell-in and inventory restocking, suggesting a positive trend despite potential softness in the Chinese market and a weaker outlook for the upcoming quarter.Regulatory EnvironmentsRegulatory scrutiny has been a thorn in Apple's side. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has partially attributed regulatory scrutiny to the Apple Card, and the ongoing Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) anti-trust trial poses potential headline risks due to its default search engine deal with Google.Customer Base and Management StrategyApple's customer base remains robust, with high brand retention and popularity among teenagers suggesting sustained future demand. The management strategy has been to incentivize direct sales, which may lead to higher margins and cross-selling opportunities.External Factors and Upcoming Product LaunchesExternal factors, such as geopolitical tensions between the US and China, have put pressure on Apple's stock. Despite this, Apple's expanding hardware and software ecosystem, along with leadership in accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, is anticipated to drive sales growth.
Upcoming product launches, including the iPhone 15 and other hardware equipped with new M3 chips, are expected to stimulate consumer interest and sales. The M3 chips, built with advanced 3nm technology, feature significant improvements in GPU performance, which could drive a switch from Intel-based models to in-house models due to better performance and integration with other Apple products.Stock PerformanceApple's stock performance has been a subject of intense scrutiny. The company's market capitalization is a testament to its financial might, with figures fluctuating around the $3 trillion mark. Analysts have maintained a largely positive outlook, with price targets reflecting confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects. However, Apple Inc. is trading at 19.3x '25 adjusted EBITDA, which is considered expensive compared to the three-year average of 18.7x, ten-year average of 12.0x, and peer average of 14.8x, as noted by KeyBanc.Bear CaseWhat are the main risks for Apple's future performance?The loss of the partnership with Goldman Sachs could affect customer incentives and payment options. New partnerships may come with less favorable terms due to awareness of Goldman's losses. The potential for market share loss if competitors like Huawei continue to grow aggressively and supply constraints could limit sales performance and affect short-term revenue. Additional risks include lower sales of high-end 'Pro' models in China and anticipated weaker hardware performance in the March quarter.Could regulatory challenges significantly impact Apple's earnings?Regulatory risks associated with the App Store revenue model could pose significant challenges. Economic slowdowns, particularly in China, could impact sales. Potential tariffs affecting imports could increase costs or affect supply chains. The ongoing Google anti-trust trial, if resulting in unfavorable outcomes, could risk a portion of Apple's net income.Bull CaseHow can Apple maintain its market dominance amidst competition?Apple remains the dominant player in high-end Chinese smartphones. The company has shown resilience despite supply constraints and competitive pressures. Apple's focus on high-end devices with higher ASPs allows it to earn a significant portion of market revenue despite lower unit share. Strong growth in iPhone sales for the initial months of the year suggests a positive outlook.What growth opportunities does Apple have?Emerging markets, particularly India, present huge untapped growth opportunities. The ecosystem of ~1.2B iPhones offers significant room for monetization through new services. Gross margins could structurally increase due to a higher mix of services and vertical integration.SWOT AnalysisStrengths:
- Strong brand and market presence in high-end smartphones.
- Diversified revenue streams with growth in services.
- Robust customer loyalty and ecosystem stickiness.
Weaknesses:
- Regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges.
- Competitive pressures, especially in China.
- Dependence on the success of the iPhone product cycle.
Opportunities:
- Expansion into emerging markets like India.
- Growth in services and potential for new product categories.
- Technological advancements, such as the M3 chips, driving product refreshes.
Threats:
- Geopolitical risks, including US-China tensions.

- Economic downturns affecting consumer spending.Analysts Targets- Evercore ISI: Outperform rating with a price target of $210.00 (November 2023).

The analyses used to compile this article range from September to December 2023.InvestingPro InsightsAs investors weigh the various factors influencing Apple Inc.'s performance, real-time data and expert analysis from InvestingPro provide additional context. The company's market capitalization remains a testament to its financial strength, with a staggering $3.01 trillion valuation. This aligns with Apple's reputation for high earnings quality, as evidenced by its free cash flow consistently exceeding net income, a key indicator of financial health and efficiency.
InvestingPro data highlights a P/E ratio of 31.44, with a slight adjustment to 31.04 when looking at the last twelve months as of Q4 2023. This signals that the stock is trading at a premium relative to its earnings, which is further underscored by a high Price / Book ratio of 48.45 for the same period. Despite revenue contraction by -2.8% in the last twelve months, Apple's strong return on assets at 27.5% showcases its ability to generate profits from its asset base. These metrics, combined with a consistent dividend growth of 4.35% and a track record of raising dividends for 12 consecutive years, suggest a stable return for shareholders.

This collaboration has led to the integration of cutting-edge technologies like ChatGPT into Microsoft's operations, potentially transforming the company's AI ambitions. Moreover, Microsoft's involvement with OpenAI has undergone strategic organizational changes, potentially favoring Microsoft in commercializing AI advancements.
The company's move into AI is not without its challenges, though. Analysts have expressed concerns over the management of hypergrowth technologies and the fragile nature of OpenAI's nonprofit board structure, which could affect governance and stability. Nonetheless, Microsoft's long-term aspirations to control its AI destiny could have significant implications for its growth and industry positioning.Regulatory Environment and Customer BaseMicrosoft's customer base spans across large enterprises and individual consumers worldwide. The company's commitment to innovation and technology has secured a loyal following, with products like Azure and Office 365 being staples in the enterprise world. However, Microsoft's global reach also subjects it to various regulatory environments, which could impact its operations, especially as it delves deeper into AI and cloud computing.Management and StrategyUnder the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has embraced a strategy that prioritizes cloud computing and AI. The company's executive decisions, such as the involvement in OpenAI's board changes, reflect a deliberate approach to secure a favorable position in the AI market. Microsoft's management has been commended for its efficient cost management, reflected in the company's robust operating income.Potential Impacts of External FactorsMicrosoft's journey is not without potential headwinds. Analysts have pointed out that macroeconomic pressures and a high-rate environment could pose risks to the company's performance.

The M365 Copilot is set to become a pivotal product, with its general availability potentially accelerating Microsoft's revenue growth in AI. Additionally, the integration of ChatGPT and other AI technologies into Microsoft's product suite is expected to create new revenue streams and solidify its position in the AI space.Stock PerformanceIn terms of stock performance, Microsoft has maintained a resilient posture. While the exact current stock price is not provided, the company's market capitalization reflects its status as a heavyweight in the industry. The stock has received positive ratings from analysts, with price targets suggesting confidence in Microsoft's future prospects.Bear CaseIs Microsoft's AI strategy a risk to its cloud dominance?The company's aggressive push into AI, while seen as a growth driver, could also present risks. Analysts have noted that Microsoft's AI strategy needs careful management to avoid jeopardizing its cloud ambitions. The potential for AI to disrupt existing business models and introduce new competitive dynamics may require Microsoft to adapt quickly to maintain its cloud dominance.Can Microsoft navigate the complex AI regulatory landscape?As Microsoft deepens its involvement in AI, the company faces a complex regulatory landscape that could impact its operations. Analysts have raised concerns about the potential for increased scrutiny and regulation of AI technologies, which could pose challenges for Microsoft. Ensuring compliance and navigating these regulations will be critical for the company's continued success in AI.Bull CaseWill Microsoft's AI investments accelerate its growth?Analysts are bullish about Microsoft's strategic investments in AI, particularly through its partnership with OpenAI.

The company's early move into AI is seen as a first-mover advantage that could capitalize on a rapidly expanding market.Can Microsoft's cloud services lead the AI revolution?Microsoft's Azure cloud platform is uniquely positioned to lead the AI revolution. With strong growth in the public cloud sector and Azure's AI capabilities, Microsoft is expected to outperform its peers.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pro-research-wall-street-deep-dive-into-amazons-market-dynamics-3248996,"Dec 04, 2023","In the ever-evolving landscape of global technology companies, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). continues to stand as a colossus across various sectors, including e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. With its sprawling footprint, Amazon's diverse portfolio has positioned it as a key player in numerous markets. Analysts, including those at Wedbush Securities and Evercore ISI, have been closely monitoring Amazon's performance and strategic moves, offering a wealth of insights into the company's current state and future prospects.Performance in Different MarketsAmazon has consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability in its core e-commerce operations. Despite facing stiff competition and a dynamic retail environment, the company has maintained a robust growth trajectory, underpinned by its expansive product offerings and a sophisticated fulfillment network. The company's e-commerce segment continues to benefit from market consolidation and the enduring shift towards online shopping. Margin expansion in North America Retail is expected due to reduced fulfillment and shipping costs, driven by better capacity utilization and regionalized operations.
In cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) stands as a pillar of strength for the company. AWS has been a consistent revenue driver, showcasing Amazon's deep technical expertise and innovation capacity. With a slower pace of global infrastructure expansion projected, AWS is expected to gain market share in 2024 due to AI innovation and a full-stack strategy, reflecting an optimistic outlook for Amazon's cloud services.
Digital advertising has emerged as another high-margin business for Amazon. The company's advertising segment has seen accelerated growth, with projections indicating a continuation of this trend. The expansion of full-funnel and off-Amazon advertising growth is anticipated to unlock additional revenue streams, further cementing Amazon's position in the advertising space. Wedbush Securities projects Amazon to generate $46.5 billion in advertising revenue in 2023, with expectations to continue capturing a larger share of global digital ad spending, indicating the company's significant growth potential in this area.Product Segments and DetailsAmazon's product segmentation reflects its strategic focus on diversification and innovation. The company's e-commerce platform remains its most visible segment, offering an extensive array of products that cater to a wide range of consumer needs. Amazon's physical store presence, including formats like Amazon Go, Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Style stores, provides a tangible extension of its retail prowess.
AWS, as a standalone product segment, has been instrumental in establishing Amazon's dominance in the cloud services market. AWS's comprehensive suite of services, including computing power, storage solutions, and AI capabilities, has attracted a diverse customer base, ranging from startups to large enterprises.
The digital streaming and AI segments are increasingly becoming focal points for Amazon. Initiatives such as Prime Video and the development of Alexa's conversational abilities highlight the company's commitment to integrating AI into its services and improving the user experience.Competitive Landscape and Market TrendsThe competitive landscape for Amazon is multifaceted, with the company facing challenges across its various operations. In e-commerce, Amazon continues to fend off competition from traditional retailers and digital upstarts alike. The rise of Chinese retail platforms like Shein and Temu has introduced new competitive dynamics, although Amazon's robust supply chain and delivery advantages have helped it maintain its market leadership.
In cloud computing, AWS competes directly with other tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). While AWS has been a leader in scale and innovation, it operates in a market where competitors are also heavily investing in their cloud offerings, particularly in the realm of AI and machine learning.
The digital advertising space sees Amazon going head-to-head with established players like Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:META). However, Amazon's unique position as an e-commerce platform provides it with valuable consumer data that enhances its advertising capabilities. The company's advertising platform is still in the early stages of development, and the extension of Sponsored Product ads beyond Amazon and the monetization of Prime Video ads by 2024 present new revenue opportunities, as noted by Wedbush Securities.Regulatory EnvironmentsRegulatory scrutiny remains a persistent theme for Amazon. The company has faced investigations and legal challenges in various jurisdictions over its business practices. These include antitrust concerns related to its marketplace operations and potential anti-competitive behavior. While Amazon has navigated these issues with a degree of success, the regulatory environment continues to pose risks that could impact the company's strategic flexibility and operational efficiency.Customer Base and ManagementAmazon boasts a vast and diverse customer base, with over 300 million active customers as of March 2022. This customer base is a testament to the company's ability to attract and retain shoppers through competitive pricing, a broad selection of products, and a focus on convenience.
The company's management team has been pivotal in steering Amazon through various market cycles and challenges. Their strategic decisions, from expanding into new markets like healthcare to optimizing the company's vast fulfillment network, have played a crucial role in Amazon's sustained growth.Strategy and External FactorsAmazon's strategy revolves around continuous innovation, customer-centricity, and expansion into new markets. The company's investments in AI and machine learning are indicative of its long-term vision to remain at the forefront of technological advancements. Additionally, Amazon's approach to physical retail, through acquisitions and the launch of new store formats, reflects its understanding of the evolving retail landscape.
External factors such as macroeconomic conditions, consumer spending patterns, and technological shifts have a significant impact on Amazon's operations. The company has shown an ability to adapt to these factors, as evidenced by its strategic cost structure adjustments and focus on high-margin segments like AWS and digital advertising.Upcoming Product LaunchesAmazon continues to innovate with upcoming product launches that span across its business segments. In the AI domain, the company is rumored to be working on an improved large language model codenamed ""Olympus,"" which could enhance its AI capabilities. The expansion of its generative AI offerings and the introduction of new services in AWS are expected to drive efficiency and cost savings for customers.
In the consumer hardware space, Amazon's hardware event previews and the rollout of new Alexa capabilities with generative AI demonstrate the company's commitment to integrating cutting-edge technology into its consumer products.Analyst Outlooks and ReasoningsAnalysts remain optimistic about Amazon's growth prospects, citing the company's strong position in its respective markets and the potential for margin expansion. While there are concerns about the competitive pressures in cloud services and generative AI, Amazon's continuous efforts to innovate and reduce costs are expected to result in share gains over time.
The bullish outlook is further supported by Amazon's strategic partnerships, such as those with Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which facilitate the development and integration of AI technologies. Additionally, Amazon's advertising services continue to impress with high operating income margins, indicating a sustained growth path.
Conversely, the bearish perspectives are primarily centered around the competitive landscape and potential regulatory challenges. The emergence of new competitors in e-commerce and cloud computing could pose threats to Amazon's market share. Furthermore, cybersecurity risks and industry-wide increases in compute prices for reserved instances could impact the growth of AWS's security tools.Bear CaseIs Amazon facing significant competitive threats?The competitive landscape for Amazon is indeed intensifying, with new players such as Temu and Shein entering the e-commerce space and tech giants like Microsoft and Google ramping up their cloud offerings. These competitors could potentially erode Amazon's market share and challenge its dominance. Additionally, regulatory challenges and consumer price sensitivity add layers of complexity to Amazon's operations.Can Amazon maintain its cloud market leadership?While AWS continues to be a leader in cloud services, the pressure from competitors investing heavily in AI and machine learning capabilities cannot be overlooked. Amazon will need to continue innovating and offering cost-effective, high-performance solutions to maintain its market position and address any concerns regarding the durability of its growth in the face of such competition.Bull CaseWill Amazon's AI investments lead to growth acceleration?Amazon's commitment to AI, as evidenced by its investments and product launches, positions the company to potentially lead in generative AI and cloud computing. The development of new AI chips and services, along with strategic partnerships, could drive further efficiency and cost savings for AWS customers, leading to growth acceleration.Can Amazon's advertising segment sustain its momentum?The digital advertising segment presents a significant growth opportunity for Amazon. With the company's vast consumer data and the introduction of video ads on Prime Video, there is a strong potential for sustained momentum in advertising revenue, contributing to Amazon's overall profitability. Wedbush Securities highlights the secular tailwinds favoring retail media and the growth in Connected TV (CTV) and video ad formats within Amazon’s properties, suggesting a bright future for this segment.SWOT AnalysisStrengths:

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pro-research-wall-street-examines-salesforces-strategic-growth-3249046,"Dec 04, 2023","In the dynamic landscape of customer relationship management (CRM) software, Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands out as a beacon of innovation and strategic growth. The company's recent financial performance, bolstered by its integrated suite of enterprise applications, has caught the attention of Wall Street, with analysts collectively maintaining a positive outlook on the stock.Performance in Different MarketsSalesforce has been exceeding growth expectations, with its stock price reflecting a robust performance in the market. The company's shares have outperformed large-cap software peers by over 20% in 2023. This performance is attributed to Salesforce's solid quarterly results, strategic partnerships, and innovative product offerings.Product Segments and DetailsSalesforce's product ecosystem, which includes customer service, marketing automation, analytics, and application development, has been central to its success. The company's strategic focus on AI and data cloud services, as exemplified by the early adoption of Einstein GPT copilots and the introduction of premium UE+ bundles, has driven substantial increases in customer spend. Salesforce's Data Cloud, featuring Mulesoft and Tableau, has shown impressive growth, indicating strong demand for its integrated services. The recent Salesforce World Tour event in NYC highlighted upcoming enhancements, including a Data Cloud Vector Database and Einstein Copilot, which aim to integrate unstructured data with structured data, leveraging technology from the Evergage acquisition.Competitive LandscapeSalesforce competes in a market teeming with innovation, where AI capabilities are increasingly becoming a differentiator. The company's emphasis on AI integration, particularly with its Einstein platform, positions it well against competitors. However, Salesforce faces challenges from other major players like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which also offer compelling CRM solutions. The expanded partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), introducing new features such as Apple Messaging, Apple Pay, and augmented reality capabilities within select Salesforce products, further intensifies the competitive dynamics.Market TrendsThe CRM market is evolving, with a growing emphasis on AI and data-driven decision-making. Salesforce has been at the forefront of this trend, as seen in its Dreamforce conference announcements and its focus on generative AI. The company's freemium offerings for its Data Cloud and Tableau products are set to increase user adoption and market penetration.Regulatory EnvironmentsSalesforce operates in a complex regulatory landscape, with various regions implementing mandatory ESG disclosures and sustainability reporting. The company's capabilities align with these trends, positioning it to thrive as digital tools for enterprise reporting become increasingly important.Customer BaseSalesforce's customer base is diverse, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. The company's robust large deal activity and the inclusion of its solutions in the majority of top deals underscore the trust and reliance customers place on Salesforce's offerings.Management and StrategyUnder the leadership of its senior management, Salesforce has returned to an execution culture with a focus on margins and cash flow growth. The company's strategic partnerships, such as those with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and now Apple, and its shareholder-friendly capital policies, including a significant buyback program, reflect a commitment to sustainable growth.Potential Impacts of External FactorsWhile Salesforce has demonstrated resilience, the macroeconomic environment poses potential risks. The company's cautious tone regarding measured spending behavior suggests market hesitancy. Additionally, professional services have faced headwinds, which could impact future performance.Upcoming Product LaunchesSalesforce's product roadmap is exciting, with the introduction of new AI capabilities through the Einstein platform and Einstein Copilot. These products are expected to enhance Salesforce's CRM workflows and provide customers with powerful AI tools for customization. The anticipated beta release of the Data Cloud Vector Database and Einstein Copilot in February 2024 signals Salesforce's continued commitment to innovation.Stock PerformanceSalesforce's stock valuation is compared to large-cap SaaS peers, and the company trades at attractive EV/revenue and EV/FCF multiples. The stock has seen a significant year-to-date increase, reflecting the market's confidence in Salesforce's growth trajectory. Wolfe Research has recently upgraded Salesforce to Outperform from Peer Perform with a new price target of US$315.00, citing double-digit growth, improved execution, and a favorable product cycle driven by GenAI. Morgan Stanley has upgraded Salesforce from Equal-weight to Overweight and raised the price target from $290.00 to $350.00, highlighting the company's significant operating margin expansion and its strong positioning for generative AI adoption.Bear CaseAre there risks to Salesforce's growth projections?While Salesforce has shown strong performance, there are concerns about its ability to sustain double-digit growth into the future. The cautious tone regarding spending behavior and the marginal decline in operating margin compared to the previous quarter suggest that there are risks to the company's growth projections. The company's long-term growth potential has been questioned, and some analysts have lowered their price targets reflecting these concerns. The actual impact of new product announcements on adoption rates is uncertain due to the early stage of customers' Data Cloud environments.Can Salesforce maintain its competitive edge in AI?Salesforce's AI advancements have been met with enthusiasm, but there is caution regarding the pace of AI adoption among customers. With competitors like Adobe and Microsoft also focusing on AI, Salesforce faces the challenge of maintaining its competitive edge. The company's ability to fully leverage generative AI and the potential challenges in disrupting established market shares in new verticals, such as life sciences, could impact its competitive positioning.Bull CaseWhat factors support a bullish outlook for Salesforce?Salesforce's robust demand for Mulesoft and Data Cloud services, early adoption of AI capabilities, and strategic focus on profitable growth post-shareholder activism support a bullish outlook. The company's raised operating margin guidance and strong cRPO growth suggest operational efficiency and resilience in the face of economic uncertainty. Large multi-cloud deals and product strength also indicate potential for sustained growth. Product enhancements could add significant value to sales, customer service, and marketing teams by integrating various data sources for improved customer interaction and support.How does Salesforce's innovation drive its market leadership?Salesforce's continuous product innovation, particularly in AI, positions it as a market leader in enterprise software. The company's strategic partnerships and its focus on integrating AI into its platform are expected to drive future growth.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pro-research-wall-streets-indepth-look-at-oracles-cloud-surge-3249382,"Dec 05, 2023","As Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) navigates through a transformative phase, its aggressive push into cloud services has caught Wall Street's attention. Analysts collectively acknowledge the company's significant strides in the cloud sector, particularly in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and its potential to reshape Oracle's growth trajectory. This deep-dive analysis will explore Oracle's performance across different markets, product segments, and competitive landscape, offering insights into the company's strategy and future outlook.Company Profile and Financial HealthOracle, a technology behemoth founded in 1977 and headquartered in Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, California, has been a cornerstone in the software industry. With a market capitalization now standing at approximately $322.249 billion, the company's financial health remains robust. Oracle's diverse portfolio includes databases, cloud-engineered systems, and enterprise software products, with its services offered through both cloud-based and on-premise deployments.
The company's stock, currently at USD 115.13, has demonstrated resilience, with a lower-than-average price movement, and it sustains a dividend yield of 1.4%. Analysts note that Oracle's P/E ratios are expected to contract from 21.9x in 2023 to 17.5x in 2025, indicating a favorable earnings outlook. However, recent revenue headwinds have led to a slight decrease in EPS estimates for FY2024 from $5.63 to $5.55 and a reduction in cash flow per share (CFPS) estimates from $3.96 to $3.50. The integration of Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) is anticipated to further bolster earnings growth, with Oracle's dividend outlook projected to rise, despite recent revenue headwinds at Cerner due to renegotiated contracts with the Veterans Affairs (VA).Cloud Business and Market PositionOracle's cloud business is a focal point of its growth strategy. Despite a notable slowdown in both IaaS and PaaS revenues, analysts predict strong cloud sales growth potential over the next several years, driven by high demand for cloud infrastructure services, particularly for AI model training. Oracle's OCI is competitive against industry giants like Azure, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS), offering potential savings of 20% to 40% over three years. The company regularly signs deals over $1 billion, with a recent infrastructure company proposing a $1.5 billion contract for AI training due to Oracle's competitive pricing.
Despite an uncertain macroeconomic environment and challenges such as tough comparisons with previous license sales, Oracle's financial guidance anticipates non-GAAP EPS growth from $5.55 in FY24 to $6.73 in FY26, on the back of consistent revenue growth. The company's valuation metrics, including a CY24E EV/revenue multiple of 6.7x, are in line with its large-cap technology peers.Competitive Landscape and Market TrendsOracle competes with industry leaders such as SAP, Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), and  MongoDB  (NASDAQ:MDB). The company's transition from licensing products to offering them on a subscription basis in the cloud is expected to improve profitability. Oracle's international revenues account for 45% of total revenues, and it maintains solid ratings from Standard & Poor's and Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
The competitive landscape is evolving with the rise of generative AI, where Oracle has established partnerships with key players like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Google. The company's focus on AI is reshaping its growth trajectory, with partnerships with digital natives and AI innovators positioning Oracle as a significant player in this space.Regulatory Environment and Customer BaseOracle's customer base spans various sectors, with the company's products being integral to enterprise software solutions. The regulatory environment has been conducive to Oracle's growth, with no major impediments noted by analysts. The company's ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, particularly in international markets, contributes to its stable customer base.Management and StrategyOracle's management has set ambitious targets, aiming for $65 billion in revenue by FY26, with operating margins of 45% and over 10% annualized EPS growth. The company's strategy includes interoperability and minimizing integration costs, a shift from its previous approach that is seen as partner-friendly. Oracle's aggressive assumptions, particularly from net new customers, suggest a total addressable market (TAM) of over $250 billion for IaaS opportunities.Potential Impacts of External FactorsExternal factors such as economic uncertainty and supply constraints in AI chips and data center construction could impact Oracle's growth. The company's valuation concerns based on EV/free cash flow metrics compared to peers and the potential failure of cloud products to offset on-premise decline are risks highlighted by analysts.Upcoming Product Launches and Stock PerformanceOracle's upcoming product launches, particularly in cloud services, are expected to drive revenue growth. The company's stock performance has outpaced the S&P 500 and the Russell 3000, indicating strong investor confidence in Oracle's growth prospects.Bear CaseIs Oracle's cloud growth sustainable?Analysts express concerns regarding the sustainability of Oracle's cloud growth. Risks include the potential failure of cloud products to offset the decline in on-premise sales, loss of market share to competitors, and a reduction in overall IT spending. Economic uncertainty may impact business operations, and revenue recognition could lag behind order signings in new ventures like AI and Health sectors. Valuation concerns based on EV/free cash flow metrics compared to peers also pose a challenge. The deceleration in cloud revenue growth and weaker non-strategic back-office SaaS revenues are additional concerns.Can Oracle maintain its competitive edge?While Oracle has shown strong AI momentum with over $4 billion in signed contracts related to its Gen2 Cloud, there are uncertainties about maintaining high growth rates due to supply constraints. The aggressive TAM, particularly from net new customers, may be overly optimistic. Questions about the ability to accelerate revenue growth and the darker days of the economic downturn yet to come could also affect Oracle's competitive edge. The long lead time between bookings and revenue generation in IaaS could impact short-term performance.Bull CaseWill Oracle's strategic partnerships drive growth?Oracle's expansion of its partnership with Microsoft and other tech giants emphasizes the importance of its technology being widely available. The company's strategy to become more partner-friendly and its interoperability approach may attract new customers seeking multi-cloud services. Large-scale contracts and customer engagements indicate robust business growth, with bullish projections on cloud revenue and the large TAM from Oracle's support base conversion and new infrastructure cloud customers. Oracle's leading market position in ERP is expected to be durable, and the infrastructure business, particularly IaaS excluding legacy hosting, and OCI Consumption showed strong year-over-year growth.Is Oracle's AI focus a game-changer?Oracle's positioning to be a significant player in AI could reshape its growth trajectory over the next 3-5 years. The company's broadening investor appetite for its role in AI, strong partnerships with leading digital and AI companies, and positive adjustments in revenue estimates due to underlying AI momentum suggest a bullish outlook. Oracle's AI-driven growth strategy and robust partnerships, despite a weaker Q2 outlook, indicate long-term revenue targets that reflect optimism about the company's trajectory.SWOT AnalysisStrengths:

- D.A. Davidson & Co.: Neutral rating with a price target of $105.00 (December 12, 2023).
This analysis is based on reports from September to December 2023.InvestingPro InsightsOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has been a consistent performer in the technology sector, and as investors consider the company's future, several InvestingPro Tips and real-time metrics offer a clearer picture of its investment potential. Notably, Oracle has raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years, signaling a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Additionally, Oracle has maintained dividend payments for 15 consecutive years, which is a testament to its financial stability and investor-friendly approach.
From a valuation standpoint, Oracle is trading at a high P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a current P/E ratio of 28.49. This could suggest that the stock is priced optimistically in terms of its earnings potential. Moreover, the company’s high Price / Book multiple of 75.51 as of the last twelve months leading up to Q2 2024, indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium for its assets relative to the book value.
In terms of performance, Oracle’s revenue growth has been slowing down recently, with a quarterly growth rate of just 5.43% in Q2 2024. This could be a point of concern for investors looking for rapid top-line expansion. However, the company’s gross profit margin remains strong at 71.88%, underscoring its ability to maintain profitability.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/google-to-test-new-feature-limiting-advertisers-use-of-browser-tracking-cookies-3257134,"Dec 14, 2023","(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google said on Thursday it will begin testing a new feature on its Chrome browser as part of a plan to ban third-party cookies that advertisers use to track consumers. The search giant is set to roll out the feature, called Tracking Protection, on Jan. 4 to 1% of Chrome users globally, that will restrict cross-site tracking by default. Google plans to completely phase out the use of third-party cookies for users in the second half of 2024.  The timeline, however, is subject to addressing antitrust concerns raised by UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Google said. The CMA has been investigating Google's plan to cut support for some cookies in Chrome, because the watchdog is worried it will impede competition in digital advertising, as well as keeping an eye on the company's biggest moneymaking segment, advertising.  Cookies are special files that allow websites and advertisers to identify individual web surfers and track their browsing habits. The European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager also said in June that the agency's investigations into Google's introduction of tools to block third-party cookies - part of the company's ""Privacy Sandbox"" initiative - would continue. 
Advertisers have said the loss of cookies in the world's most popular browser will limit their ability to collect information for personalizing ads and make them dependent on Google's user databases. Brokerage BofA Global Research said in a note on Thursday that phasing out of cookies will give more power to media agencies, especially those that are capable of providing proprietary insights at scale to advertisers.",0.2484

The commitments by healthcare providers and payers follow those of 15 leading AI companies, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), OpenAI and OpenAI partner Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to develop AI models responsibly. Biden's government is pushing to set parameters around AI as it makes rapid gains in capability and popularity while regulation remains limited. ""The administration is pulling every lever it has to advance responsible AI in health-related fields,"" the White House official said, adding AI carried enormous potential to benefit patients, doctors and hospital staff, if managed responsibly.

In addition, the company is making available a suite of tools available for developers to customize their own version of Gemini, as well as two new products that will be powered by Gemini soon, one focused on computer programming assistance and the other focused on a company's security operations. A second version of its image-generation model will be available tomorrow to developers. 
Alphabet said it is making three versions of Gemini, each of which is designed to use a different amount of processing power. The most powerful version is designed to run in data centers, and the smallest will run efficiently on mobile devices, the company said. Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT roughly a year ago, Google has been racing to produce AI software that rivals what the Microsoft-backed company has introduced.",0.9887

McBride served as the chief revenue officer for five years at GitLab, an open-source developer tools maker in GV's portfolio that went public in late 2021. The software industry veteran said he would concentrate on early-stage startups that focus on enterprise customers, including those that use open-source and AI-driven approaches. ""I've learned a lot about how open source can give startup and growth companies a big advantage. I think it's going to be a powerful business model in AI,"" McBride said.  It was important for startups built on free open-source technology to invest in both the open-source community and in growing their revenue-generating business, he said. While venture capital funding has slowed due to interest rate hikes and valuation resets, GV has completed 125 investments this year with an average of $1 billion invested annually since 2020.  The VC firm, which focuses on early-stage investments and has backed companies such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Slack, also made some unusual bets in the public market this year, purchasing stock shares of its portfolio companies from GitLab to Verve Therapeutics.  
""We're long-term investors and we have this flexibility to invest at any stage throughout a company's life, even after their IPO. We're unconstrained and we think of ourselves as aligning with what the very best founders need,"" said Dave Munichiello, general partner at GV. Launched as Google Ventures in 2009, GV now has $8 billion in assets under management from Alphabet, its sole limited partner.

U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco will decide what changes to impose on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google Play store, after a jury on Monday agreed with ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games that Google illegally barred competing Android app stores and forced developers to use its payment system for in-app transactions. Donato, a 2014 Obama appointee, will consider arguments from both sides next month, when Epic is expected to propose ways to undo Google's alleged monopoly.  Donato said near the end of the month-long trial that there was ""more than enough evidence"" for jurors to rule for Epic. Google has denied wrongdoing and said it will appeal the verdict. Donato's decision on Google's penalties also will likely be tied up in appeals. Donato declined an interview request through a court representative. Before his appointment as a judge, Donato, 63, was an antitrust specialist at corporate law firms Shearman & Sterling and Cooley. Many of his clients were technology companies and medical device manufacturers, including chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tyco Healthcare, now Covidien. In one case, Donato was a lead lawyer for United Airlines in an unsuccessful private lawsuit challenging the company's $8.5 billion merger in 2010 with Continental.  He represented the airline alongside fellow antitrust lawyer Katherine Forrest, who went on to be one of Epic's attorneys in the Google case until she switched law firms in January. The Epic case also reunited Donato with a former Stanford Law School classmate: Google's president of global affairs Kent Walker.  Donato grilled Walker during the trial over Google's deletion of internal chat logs, which the jury was later told would have aided Epic's case. Google has said it took ""robust steps to preserve relevant chats."" The judge later called Google's conduct surrounding the chat logs ""the most serious and disturbing evidence I have ever seen in my decade on the bench."" Donato has had blunt words for both defendants and plaintiffs before.  He once questioned what he called ""sweetheart"" corporate settlements in a price-fixing prosecution. In 2021, he refused to approve a $650 million Facebook (NASDAQ:META) consumer privacy settlement until lawyers in the case proposed better ways to alert potential beneficiaries.  
This year he castigated plaintiffs attorneys who had clashed in an antitrust case against Facebook, threatening to appoint new leaders for the case. Donato will next weigh in on Epic's fight with Google at a Jan. 11 hearing, when the two sides are slated to discuss next steps in the case.",-0.9073

Calling itself the Coalition for Open Digital Ecosystems (CODE), the group said it wants to promote more open platforms and systems to boost growth and innovation in Europe. The group said it will work with academics, policymakers and companies on digital openness and how this can be achieved in Europe ""through the implementation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and in future EU regulatory framework developments"". The DMA requires gatekeepers -- tech giants that control access to their platforms -- to allow third parties to inter-operate with the gatekeeper's own services and allow their business users to promote their offer and conclude contracts with their customers outside the gatekeeper's platform.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysisdriverless-vehicles-on-limited-routes-bump-along-despite-us-robotaxi-scrutiny-3255517,"Dec 13, 2023","By Abhirup Roy SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A quest for lower costs and efficiently moving goods and groups of people is pushing demand for driverless technology in trucks and shuttles, even as robotaxis battle renewed doubts after an October accident involving a General Motors (NYSE:GM) Cruise car.  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Aurora and California startup Gatik are among companies developing self-driving technology for vehicles that operate on set routes and have largely managed to avoid the public ire robotaxis have faced on busy city streets.  This has helped these companies, which mainly develop autonomous technology to equip vehicles, win large new customers like IKEA and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), as well as local governments. Gatik won grocer Kroger (NYSE:KR) and processed food maker  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) as clients this year. The company operates traditional midsized trucks fitted with its autonomous technology that deliver goods on routes that avoid hospitals and schools, and it has been hiring aggressively and plans to deepen its presence in several states.  Aurora said it is on track to start hauling freight without a driver between Dallas and Houston by the end of next year. ""We still think trucking is poised to be the first true scaling rollout of autonomous technology,"" said Don Burnette, CEO of Kodiak Robotics, which runs long-haul autonomous trucks between Houston and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Burnette said Kodiak was on track next year to start getting on the road without the safety drivers who currently stay behind the wheel. Limiting the risk of deploying across a densely populated city, Michigan-based driverless shuttle operator May Mobility aims to complement or replace human-driven transit systems within a specific area of a city. It has struck deals with local authorities. Building and commercializing driverless vehicles, especially robotaxis, has been harder and costlier than initially imagined and has prompted regulatory concerns, investor anxiety and public criticism. Detractors complain that robotaxis have disrupted traffic and put people at risk due to erratic driving or abrupt stops in the middle of busy roads.  The outcry has intensified since an Oct. 2 accident involving a pedestrian who was dragged 20 feet (6.1 m) by a Cruise robotaxi after being struck by another vehicle. The company has paused all trips except a small pilot and hired a law firm to help it conduct a safety review. Cruise has said it was ""committed to rebuilding trust"" with regulators."" Despite recent setbacks for driverless technology this year and more regulatory focus expected ahead, some companies have managed to win investments. May Mobility and Aurora raised money. Stack AV - launched by founders of defunct self-driving startup Argo AI which was backed by Ford (NYSE:F) and Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) - has attracted investments from SoftBank (TYO:9984). ROUGH RIDE  ""There's been a shift towards trucking in terms of the work being done in autonomy,"" said David Bruemmer, a board adviser at the Autonomy Institute, an industry consortium that helps research and deploy autonomous infrastructure. Self-driving trucks and shuttles that are low-speed and which operate on pre-defined routes, for use in industries such as port logistics, are seen as more valuable services and less risky, he said. Still, the autonomous trucking industry has not been immune to challenges. Several startups have struggled to continue funding their quest to develop heavy driverless trucks, slashing jobs and shutting shops.  Truckers and labor unions have called for a ban on self-driving trucks - some of which weigh over 80,000 pounds (36,287 kg) - saying they were unsafe and would lead to job losses. The concerns found legislative support in California with a bill to prevent heavy-duty driverless trucks from operating in the state, until Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed it in September. ""Sentiment in the AV (autonomous vehicle) industry is negative,"" Gatik CEO Gautam Narang said. More regulatory scrutiny and discussions around safety are expected in light of the Cruise incident, he said, and more companies will struggle next year and only a few will remain standing. 
In July, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Waymo - Cruise's rival - pushed back its autonomous trucking efforts indefinitely.  Waymo, which runs robotaxis in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix, Arizona, has ""taken a measured and incremental approach in introducing our technology to the public,"" the company's chief product officer, Saswat Panigrahi, told Reuters via email. Waymo plans to soon deploy fully autonomous robotaxis in Austin, he said.",-0.9111

The new filing late on Monday night consolidates two lawsuits brought against the Facebook and Instagram owner by comedian Sarah Silverman, Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Chabon and other prominent authors, who allege that Meta has used their works without permission to train its artificial-intelligence language model, Llama. A California judge last month dismissed part of the Silverman lawsuit and indicated that he would give the authors permission to amend their claims. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations.  The new complaint, filed on Monday, includes chat logs of a Meta-affiliated researcher discussing procurement of the dataset in a Discord server, a potentially significant piece of evidence indicating that Meta was aware that its use of the books may not be protected by U.S. copyright law. In the chat logs quoted in the complaint, researcher Tim Dettmers describes his back-and-forth with Meta's legal department over whether use of the book files as training data would be ""legally ok."" ""At Facebook, there are a lot of people interested in working with (T)he (P)ile, including myself, but in its current form, we are unable to use it for legal reasons,"" Dettmers wrote in 2021, referring to a dataset Meta has acknowledged using to train its first version of Llama, according to the complaint. The month prior, Dettmers wrote that Meta's lawyers had told him ""the data cannot be used or models cannot be published if they are trained on that data,"" the complaint said. While Dettmers does not describe the lawyers' concerns, his counterparts in the chat identify ""books with active copyrights"" as the biggest likely source of worry. They say training on the data should ""fall under fair use,"" a U.S. legal doctrine that protects certain unlicensed uses of copyrighted works. Dettmers, a doctoral student at the University of Washington, told Reuters he was not immediately able to comment on the claims. Tech companies have been facing a slew of lawsuits this year from content creators who accuse them of ripping off copyright-protected works to build generative AI models that have created a global sensation and spurred a frenzy of investment. If successful, those cases could dampen the generative AI craze, as they could raise the cost of building the data-hungry models by compelling AI companies to compensate artists, authors and other content creators for the use of their works.  At the same time, new provisional rules in Europe regulating artificial intelligence could force companies to disclose the data they use to train their models, potentially exposing them to more legal risk. Meta released a first version of its Llama large language model in February and published a list of datasets used for training, including ""the Books3 section of ThePile."" The person who assembled that dataset has said elsewhere that it contains 196,640 books, according to the complaint. 
The company did not disclose training data for its latest version of the model, Llama 2, which it made available for commercial use this summer. Llama 2 is free to use for companies with fewer than 700 million monthly active users. Its release was seen in the tech sector as a potential game-changer in the market for generative AI software, threatening to upend the dominance of players like OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that charge for use of their models.",0.9457

The new policy was not formally announced but appeared sometime over the past few days on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s publicly available law enforcement guidelines. It follows the revelation from Oregon Senator Ron Wyden that officials were requesting such data from Apple and Google, the unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that makes the operating system for Android phones. Apps of all kinds rely on push notifications to alert smartphone users to incoming messages, breaking news, and other updates. These are the audible ""dings"" or visual indicators users get when they receive an email or their sports team wins a game. What users often do not realize is that almost all such notifications travel over Google and Apple's servers. In a letter first disclosed by Reuters last week, Wyden said the practice gave the two companies unique insight into traffic flowing from those apps to users, putting them ""in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps."" Apple and Google acknowledged receiving such requests. Apple added a passage to its guidelines saying such data was available ""with a subpoena or greater legal process."" The passage has now been updated to refer to more stringent warrant requirements. 
Apple did not issue an official statement. Google said in a statement it had always required judicial approval to hand over this kind of information. Wyden said in a statement that Apple was ""doing the right thing by matching Google and requiring a court order to hand over push notification related data.""",0.9826

A jury in California found on Monday that the Alphabet-owned company's Play app store operated as an illegal monopoly, quashing competition and charging app developers unduly high fees of up to 30%. Epic Games will now have a chance to submit a court filing on how it wants Google's Play Store to be fixed -- potentially putting at risk what Wells Fargo estimates is $10 billion in annual revenue from app sales and in-app purchases for the tech giant. ""This is a big win for Epic,"" said Pinar Akman, professor of competition law at the University of Leeds.  ""The usual remedy in such case ... would mean Google may be required to allow developers to use payment systems other than Google's. If such a remedy is adopted, then that will have an impact on the entire ecosystem and business model.""  Google takes a cut on each digital purchase through Play Store on Android, the mobile system it develops. While revenue from such transactions is a fraction of the total sales, it's a high-margin business for the company, according to analysts. The remedies could force it to allow rival app stores or lower the fees it charges on app sales and in-app purchases. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares were down nearly 1% on Tuesday. The unanimous ruling by the jury will intensify pressure on Google at a time it is caught in a legal battle with the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ), which has accused the online search leader of breaking antitrust law to stay on top.  ""It's worth noting the ad tech case is also a jury trial. Ad tech is more complicated than app stores, but DOJ still must be feeling encouraged by last night's jury ruling,"" analysts at TD Cowen said. The decision is also expected to deepen questions over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s market dominance. The company won a similar fight against Epic but both the companies have approached the Supreme Court to review their dispute. While it may not directly impact the case, the Google ruling will amplify questions about the influence Apple exerts through its App Store, said Eleanor Fox, professor emerita at the New York University School of Law. ""Apple might be and should be more concerned that it will be found to be a monopoly,"" Fox said. LENGTHY APPEALS PROCESS Google has said it will appeal the verdict, and the case will head to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That is the same court that heard Epic's arguments last year to revive its antitrust claims against Apple.  In January, U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco will weigh Epic's request for an injunction. Epic and Google will face off for a second time in court — before the judge only. Google would likely argue that the proposed injunction is too broad and needs to be more tailored.  ""It's not so much will there be an injunction but the strength and scope of that remedy,"" said antitrust legal scholar Christine Bartholomew of the University at Buffalo School of Law in New York. 
Still, analysts expect Google to appeal any remedy orders from Judge Donato, delaying any potential changes. ""Using the timeline in Epic v. Apple as a guide, the 9th Circuit would likely rule around Q2 2025,"" TD Cowen said.",0.9794
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/explainerepic-games-verdict-adds-to-googles-global-antitrust-woes-3254998,"Dec 12, 2023","By Mike Scarcella (Reuters) - “Fortnite” maker Epic Games won a major antitrust trial against Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google in San Francisco, persuading a federal jury on Monday that some of the technology giant’s rules for its app Play store violated U.S. competition law. Here’s a look at what’s next in the case, and other major antitrust headaches facing Google. WHAT WAS THE VERDICT?  The jury said, after just three hours of deliberations, that Google’s tight controls on its Play store amounted to an illegal monopoly over both app distribution to Android users and in-app payment processing. Epic did not ask the court for monetary damages. A judge had ruled earlier that Google improperly deleted internal online “chat” logs relevant to Epic's claims. The jury was told that the evidence would have been unfavorable to Google.  WHAT COMES NEXT? U.S. District Judge James Donato in January will hear dueling arguments on Epic’s request for a court order to rewrite how Google operates the Play store. Google could object that whatever changes Epic proposes are too sweeping. Google said it will appeal the jury’s verdict. It could also appeal Donato's eventual decision on Epic's requested remedies, potentially teeing up years of additional litigation. WHAT ABOUT EPIC’S CASE AGAINST APPLE? Google’s appeal will land in the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — the same court that heard Epic's separate 2020 antitrust case against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over its App Store rules. The appeals court in April largely ruled for Apple, upholding a 2021 decision by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) that said Apple’s app rules did not violate antitrust law.  Legal scholars noted that the facts of the two cases were distinct, and said a key difference was that the case against Apple was decided by the judge directly, with no jury. Epic's bid to revive the Apple case is now pending at the U.S. Supreme Court. Apple also appealed a part of the court’s order that would require it to make some changes to its App Store. WHAT OTHER ANTITRUST CASES IS GOOGLE FIGHTING? Google faces an array of private civil antitrust lawsuits from U.S. advertisers and publishers, in addition to U.S. government claims challenging its search and advertising technology practices. In the E.U., Google is trying to overturn a $2.6 billion antitrust fine imposed by the top court for alleged market abuses related to its shopping service. 
The verdict in Epic Games’ case does not directly affect those other cases, but it could spur other potential plaintiffs such as businesses and app developers to band together in a class action, antitrust lawyers said. Google likely faces a jury trial next year in Virginia in a case brought by the U.S. Justice Department and a group of states over its dominance in digital advertising. Google has denied any wrongdoing.",0.6832
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/futures-edge-higher-with-all-eyes-on-inflation-data-3254562,"Dec 12, 2023","By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks closed at fresh highs of the year on Tuesday, after inflation data did little to alter views for the timing of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, as investors awaited the central bank's last policy decision of the year on Wednesday. The November Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.1% on an annual basis, in line with estimates from economists polled by Reuters, as a drop in gasoline prices was overshadowed by a rise in rents. Core prices, excluding volatile items such as food and energy costs, also matched expectations, showing a 4% annual rise. On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices ticked up 0.1% last month, compared with estimates of remaining unchanged. Markets had recently been pricing in a rate cut by the Federal Reserve as soon as March, but traders pared those bets and are now targeting May for the first rate cut after the central bank began its hiking cycle in March 2022.  Expectations for a cut of at least 25 basis points in March fell to 43.7%, from about 50% before the data, according to the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch Tool. The market is now pricing in a chance of about 78% for a cut in May, up from about 75% on Monday.  ""The market is certainly assuming that inflation is going to keep coming down, that earnings in this next year are going to show some decent growth and the Fed is going to cut rates,"" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.  ""The market is counting on more of a soft landing that would allow the Fed to ease up."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 173.01 points, or 0.48%, to 36,577.94, the S&P 500 gained 21.26 points, or 0.46%, to 4,643.70 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 100.91 points, or 0.70%, to 14,533.40.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/europe-agrees-landmark-ai-regulation-deal-3254100,"Dec 11, 2023","By Foo Yun Chee, Martin Coulter and Supantha Mukherjee BRUSSELS/LONDON/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Europe on Friday reached a provisional deal on landmark European Union rules governing the use of artificial intelligence including governments' use of AI in biometric surveillance and how to regulate AI systems such as ChatGPT. With the political agreement, the EU moves toward becoming the first major world power to enact laws governing AI. Friday's deal between EU countries and European Parliament members came after nearly 15 hours of negotiations that followed an almost 24-hour debate the previous day. The two sides are set to hash out details in the coming days, which could change the shape of the final legislation. ""Europe has positioned itself as a pioneer, understanding the importance of its role as a global standard setter. This is yes, I believe, a historical day,"" European Commissioner Thierry Breton told a press conference. The accord requires foundation models such as ChatGPT and general purpose AI systems (GPAI) to comply with transparency obligations before they are put on the market. These include drawing up technical documentation, complying with EU copyright law and disseminating detailed summaries about the content used for training. High-impact foundation models with systemic risk will have to conduct model evaluations, assess and mitigate systemic risks, conduct adversarial testing, report to the European Commission on serious incidents, ensure cybersecurity and report on their energy efficiency. GPAIs with systemic risk may rely on codes of practice to comply with the new regulation. Governments can only use real-time biometric surveillance in public spaces in cases of victims of certain crimes, prevention of genuine, present, or foreseeable threats, such as terrorist attacks, and searches for people suspected of the most serious crimes. The agreement bans cognitive behavioural manipulation, the untargeted scrapping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage, social scoring and biometric categorisation systems to infer political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation and race. Consumers would have the right to launch complaints and receive meaningful explanations while fines for violations would range from 7.5 million euros ($8.1 million) or 1.5% of turnover to 35 million euros or 7% of global turnover. Business group DigitalEurope criticised the rules as yet another burden for companies, on top of other recent legislation. ""We have a deal, but at what cost? We fully supported a risk-based approach based on the uses of AI, not the technology itself, but the last-minute attempt to regulate foundation models has turned this on its head,"" its Director General Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl said. Privacy rights group European Digital Rights was equally critical. ""It’s hard to be excited about a law which has, for the first time in the EU, taken steps to legalise live public facial recognition across the bloc,"" its senior policy advisor Ella Jakubowska said.  ""Whilst the Parliament fought hard to limit the damage, the overall package on biometric surveillance and profiling is at best lukewarm.""  The legislation is expected to enter into force early next year once both sides formally ratify it and should apply two years after that. Governments around the world are seeking to balance the advantages of the technology, which can engage in human-like conversations, answer questions and write computer code, against the need to put guardrails in place. Europe's ambitious AI rules come as companies like OpenAI, in which Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an investor, continue to discover new uses for their technology, triggering both plaudits and concerns. Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Thursday launched a new AI model, Gemini, to rival OpenAI. 
The EU law could become the blueprint for other governments and an alternative to the United States' light-touch approach and China's interim rules. ($1 = 0.9293 euros)",0.9431

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/australias-central-bank-aims-at-broad-reform-for-payments-systems-3254300,"Dec 11, 2023","SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's central bank is considering a slate of new regulations for the payments system to open the use of mobile wallets, make costs more transparent and allow retailers to put surcharges on buy-now-pay-later services. In a speech on Tuesday, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Michele Bullock also outlined efforts to support the struggling business of moving cash around the country and plans to modernise the direct entry system used for salaries and welfare payments. The Australian government is greatly expanding the RBA's regulatory power over the payments system, particularly for mobile wallet services offered by the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Bullock said the powers should be in place sometime next year, allowing the RBA to launch a broad review of the retail payments system.  ""Usage of mobile wallets has grown rapidly, but the costs associated with these services remain opaque and payment service providers can face barriers to access,"" she added. ""We will need to consider whether regulatory action is needed in this area.""  It will also consider formal regulation to allow retailers to place surcharges on BNPL services, much as they do on credit cards. Regulation might also be needed to ensure retailers have access to least-cost routing, which financial institutions have been slow to roll out, Bullock said. The RBA will continue its work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and is planning a project to examine how different forms of digital money and infrastructure could support the development of tokenised asset markets in Australia.  It will also support the transition from the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS) to the New Payments Platform (NPP), while expanding the NPP's use for cross-border transactions. Bullock noted that financial institutions would need to connect to the NPP all relevant accounts that currently send and receive payments via BECS, which processes around three-quarters of non-cash payments by value and is heavily relied on by many businesses and government agencies.  
Bullock voiced disappointment that some NPP participants were still not ready to provide cross-border payments services this month, urging the industry to deliver on this commitment as soon as possible. ""In the end, if it requires a mandate or a regulation, then we will do it but we prefer really just to work with the industry to get it done,"" said Bullock at the Q&A.",0.9695
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/google-epic-games-face-off-as-app-antitrust-trial-nears-end-3254075,"Dec 11, 2023","By Greg Bensinger and Mike Scarcella (Reuters) -""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games has prevailed in its high-profile antitrust trial over Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, which alleged the Play app store operated as an illegal monopoly, in a ruling that if it holds could upend the entire app store economy. Jurors found for Epic on all counts, a court filing showed, after more than a month of trial in Epic's lawsuit, which accused Google of taking action to quash competitors and charge unduly high fees of up to 30% to app developers. The court in January will begin work on what remedies to implement. The ruling marks a stunning defeat for Google, which alongside Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) operates one of the world's largest app stores. If the ruling holds, it has the potential to give developers more sway over how their apps are distributed and how they profit off them. Google said it would appeal. ""We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem,"" Wilson White, vice president of government affairs and public policy at Google, said in an emailed statement. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney on Monday cheered the ruling on social media site X, calling out ""the Google Play monopoly."" Lawyers for the two companies made their final arguments on Monday morning and the federal judge handed the case to the jury less than four hours earlier, with instructions that a decision must be unanimous. Among Epic's allegations were that Google illegally ties together its Play store and billing service, meaning developers were required to use both to have their apps included in the store. While the Play store represents a much smaller chunk of Google's revenue compared to its massively profitable search business, it is symbolically important as the central gatekeeper to billions of mobile phones and tablets.  Google may be compelled to allow for more app stores on Android-powered devices and lose revenue from the cut it takes out of in-app purchases.  ""(Today's verdict) proves that Google's app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation,"" Epic said in a statement on its website. GOOGLE ACCUSED OF DELETING MESSAGES ""The trial has shone a very bright light on what Google has done to impair the competition,"" a lawyer for Epic, Gary Bornstein, told jurors earlier in the day, adding Google ""systematically blocks"" alternative app stores on the company's Play store.  Among the more sensational allegations were that Google had a system for deleting texts and internal messages for the purpose of concealing its anticompetitive behavior. An attorney for Epic instructed jurors on Monday that they could assume the content of the deleted messages was pertinent to the case and ""would have been unfavorable to Google."" Google has denied wrongdoing, arguing that it competes ""intensely on price, quality, and security"" against Apple's App Store. A lawyer for Google, Jonathan Kravis, told jurors that ""Google does not want to lose 60 million Android users to Apple every year."" Google lowered its fee structure to compete with Apple, Kravis said. ""This is not the behavior of a monopolist,"" he said. Google settled related claims from dating app maker Match before the trial started. The tech giant also settled related antitrust claims by U.S. states and consumers under terms that have not been made public. Epic lodged a similar antitrust case against Apple in 2020, but a U.S. judge largely ruled in favor of Apple in September 2021. 
Epic has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to revive key claims in the Apple case, and Apple is fighting part of a ruling for Epic that would require changes to App Store rules. Epic purposefully violated Play store rules by skirting its billing systems allowing for customers to make in-app purchases directly with Epic, an attorney for the gamemaker said on Monday. As a result, Google banned ""Fortnite"" and Epic filed its suit in response.",-0.1241

Shares of fabless chip and software maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)
jumped 6.1% in the morning session after Citigroup resumed coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and assigned a price target of $1,100, emphasizing the company's robust core business and anticipated gains from the VMware (NYSE:VMW) acquisition. The analysis also highlighted Broadcom's potential to double AI revenue from $4.0 billion in FY23 to over $8.0 billion in FY24. 
2023 has been a banner year for AI stocks, from pure-play software platforms to AI chip developers and hardware accelerators. Broadcom combines the best of both worlds via its custom AI accelerator offerings. Its chips help ensure that AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Bard can reply quickly when you ask them something. Because Broadcom's chips are really good at making networks work fast, the company is expected to do well as more people want to use AI technology like ChatGPT. 
As a reminder, Broadcom reported Generative AI revenue, driven by Ethernet solutions and custom AI accelerators, of approximately $1.5 billion in FY'23, or 20% of semiconductor revenue. In FY'24, the company expects revenue from generative AI to represent more than 25% of the semiconductor revenue. This highlights the growing momentum in the AI segment, showing that Broadcom is positioned for promising growth in the flourishing AI market.
Is now the time to buy Broadcom? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.
What is the market telling us:
Broadcom's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 7 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. 
The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago, when the stock gained 8.5% as the company's stock enjoyed bullish sentiments from Wall Street analysts who expect huge potential in the artificial intelligence market. KeyBanc Capital Markets' John Vinh expects Broadcom to benefit in the near-term from its generative AI capabilities--specifically, its TPU product. JPMorgan's Harlan Sur echoed this and praised Broadcom's custom-chip business, which he said is ""gaining traction with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for its cutting-edge AI processor chip, TPU.""
Broadcom is up 87% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Broadcom's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,192.",0.9949
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/oracles-revenue-miss-highlights-cloud-computing-hurdles-3254317,"Dec 11, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) encountered a significant setback as it reported second-quarter revenues that fell short of expectations, highlighting the tech giant's struggles in a highly competitive cloud computing market. The company's revenue of $12.94 billion missed the analysts' average estimate of $13.05 billion, reflecting broader economic pressures and intense competition. This news prompted a sharp 9% decline in Oracle's shares in extended trading, underscoring investor concerns about the company's ability to keep pace in the evolving cloud sector.
The challenging economic landscape, characterized by persistent inflation and high borrowing costs, has led many firms to tighten their spending. This trend has particularly impacted companies like Oracle, which rely heavily on enterprise spending. The slowdown in cloud spending isn't isolated to Oracle; even tech giants like Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have experienced similar challenges, as evidenced by the slowest growth in its cloud division in recent quarters. This environment raises concerns about the overall demand for cloud services.
Market Overview:
-Oracle shares plunge over 9% in extended trading following Q2 earnings miss.
-Sticky inflation and high borrowing costs dampen enterprise spending.
-Cloud competition intensifies, with Oracle struggling to gain ground against dominant players.
Key Points:
-Oracle reports Q2 revenue of $12.94 billion, below analyst estimates of $13.05 billion.
-Economic uncertainties and cloud competition weigh on demand for Oracle's offerings.
-Oracle's AI ambitions face stiff challenges from established players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
-Company narrowly beats earnings estimates with an adjusted EPS of $1.34.
Looking Ahead:
-Navigate Economic Uncertainties: Oracle must strategically address economic headwinds to mitigate their negative impact on business performance.
-Differentiate Cloud Offerings: The company needs to identify and leverage unique strengths to differentiate its cloud solutions and attract new customers.
-Capitalize on Emerging Trends: Actively investing in and capitalizing on emerging technologies like AI could offer a competitive advantage.
-Improve Operational Efficiency: Implementing cost-effective measures and streamlining operations can enhance profitability and financial stability.
-Address Competitive Pressures: Carefully analyze competitor strategies and develop effective countermeasures to maintain market position.
Despite Oracle's efforts to enhance its offerings, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI infrastructure, it faces formidable competition from established market leaders Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). These larger players have already secured substantial market shares and continue to lead in AI and cloud services, as seen in Microsoft's recent earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, propelled by growth in its AI-driven cloud segment. This market dynamic poses a significant challenge for Oracle, limiting its opportunity to carve out a substantial share in the AI ecosystem.
Oracle's second-quarter performance, while not meeting revenue expectations, did see a slight silver lining. The company reported an adjusted net income of $3.76 billion, marginally beating the Street estimates of $3.74 billion. Additionally, its adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 marginally exceeded the forecasted $1.32. However, these small victories are overshadowed by the larger narrative of Oracle's struggle to adapt and grow in a rapidly changing and competitive cloud computing landscape.

The Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) was launched in 2021 at COP26 in Glasgow and its funding comes from governments, companies, and non-governmental organizations.  Globally, food and farming contribute about a third of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. Nearly 80 projects have been announced under the AIM for Climate initiative since 2021, with goals to expand agricultural research, implement sustainable farming practices, and reduce methane emissions. ""This partnership embodies our shared commitment to accelerating investments in transformative food systems and climate-smart agricultural innovations,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement. Funding for the effort has grown from $13 billion in May, when the U.S. and UAE co-hosted an AIM for Climate summit in Washington, and from $8 billion at COP27. The new total includes $12 billion from governments and $5 billion from non-government parties such as companies and humanitarian organizations, said an AIM for Climate spokesperson. The 27 new projects announced at COP28 range in size from $500 million to $150,000. Partners in one of the largest initiatives, aimed at expanding regenerative agriculture, include  Bunge  (NYSE:BG), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), The Nature Conservancy and the Brazilian state of Para. Regenerative agriculture generally refers to practices like reduced tillage of cropland and lower pesticide use. For the first time, agriculture is a major focus at this year's climate summit, with a full day on Dec. 10 dedicated to food and farming topics.  ""We are witnessing tremendous progress in transforming the global food and agricultural systems at COP28,"" said UAE Minister for Climate and the Environment Mariam Almheiri in a statement.

Analysts are closely watching the altcoin, which is often influenced by Bitcoin's market performance. The predictions suggest that if Bitcoin reaches the $100,000 mark following its halving, SHIB could experience a 433.29% increase to $0.00005564. An even more impressive Bitcoin surge to $250,000 could potentially propel SHIB by an astonishing 1,233% to $0.00013856.
The enthusiasm surrounding Shiba Inu is not solely based on its correlation with Bitcoin. The dog-themed cryptocurrency's potential is also being fueled by the expected launch of Shibarium, a technological upgrade designed to enhance transaction capabilities. This development is poised to draw both investment and usage, contributing to SHIB's growth prospects.
Moreover, Shiba Inu's appeal is further strengthened by an ongoing token burn campaign aimed at increasing its scarcity and thereby its perceived value among investors. Such strategic initiatives are reminiscent of past meme coin rallies and could signal a new era of heightened interest and value in Shiba Inu as these milestones approach.

The comments from Google's director Oliver Bethell and its vice president for global ads Dan Taylor came after the U.S. tech giant responded to EU charges issued to the company in June. ""We are opposed to divestment. We don't think that's the right outcome for this case. We think this is a tremendously efficient part of our business,"" Bethell told reporters. ""And that kind of remedy would be disproportionate in the circumstances and we have explained that to the Commission in our response to their statement of objections,"" he said. The European Commission said Google has since 2014 abused its dominance in the online advertising technology industry via its market power on both sides of the supply chain.  It has done that, the Commission says, by ensuring that both its intermediation tools on the buy-side and on the sell-side would favour its own ad exchange AdX in the matching auctions. Taylor said it was common practice in the industry to serve both advertisers and publishers, with a number of rivals doing the same. ""There are many firms that have competing adtech businesses with us, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Criteo, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and others,"" he told reporters. ""They offer ad platforms and tools like ours that cater to both advertisers and publishers. Now it is common to do this in the industry because it benefits both advertisers and publishers,"" Taylor said. ""Integrated technology stacks will make it easier to provide high quality connections that match the right advertiser to the right ad slot on a publisher page."" The stakes are higher for Google in this latest clash with regulators as it concerns a portion of the company's advertising business which accounted for 79% of total revenue last year and making it its biggest money maker.  
Its 2022 advertising revenue, including from search services, Gmail, Google Play, Google Maps, YouTube adverts, Google Ad Manager, AdMob and AdSense, amounted to $224.5 billion.

The increase reflects confidence in Apple's services sector and anticipated improvements in the gross margins of the upcoming iPhone 15, along with robust consumer interest in the company's Vision Pro technology.
Morgan Stanley's optimism is further buoyed by recent stability in iPhone production, which has shifted the focus toward recovery drivers such as service offerings, gross margin enhancements, and Edge AI capabilities. These factors are expected to contribute to market share gains and potentially reduce the time between iPhone upgrades for consumers.
The firm remains positive about Apple's competitive edge in managing its App Store, even as it faces potential regulatory challenges in the EU that may require accommodation of third-party app stores. Moreover, ongoing legal scrutiny concerning Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s agreements with Apple has not dampened the firm's outlook.
Despite concerns over waning iPhone demand in China and lower retention rates compared to 2013, near-term risks related to production cuts seem minimal. Morgan Stanley suggests that the accelerated iPhone upgrade cycle driven by Edge AI technology could lead to substantial revenue increases beyond current forecasts.
As of December 2023, amidst these favorable conditions, Apple has once again achieved a market capitalization of $3 trillion.

The CMA's inquiry seeks to determine if the collaboration between these two tech entities amounts to a de facto merger, potentially leading to a formal investigation. This regulatory scrutiny comes in the wake of significant changes at OpenAI, including the temporary dismissal and reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman and the formation of a new board featuring notable figures such as Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D’Angelo.
Microsoft's substantial investment in OpenAI, totaling $13 billion for a 49% stake in its for-profit arm, has raised questions about the level of influence and control it might exert over OpenAI's operations. The CMA's concern revolves around whether recent governance changes, particularly Microsoft gaining a nonvoting observer position on OpenAI’s board, could impact competition in the AI market. This investigation could lead to significant outcomes, including a potential order for structural or behavioral changes in the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI.
Market Overview:
-CMA is seeking feedback on whether the partnership constitutes a de facto merger.
-Microsoft will have a non-voting observer position on OpenAI's board.
-An investigation could lead to structural or behavioral changes for the companies.
Key Points:
-OpenAI's recent governance changes, including the firing and reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman, prompted CMA's inquiry.
-Microsoft invested $13 billion in OpenAI's for-profit arm in 2019.
-The CMA's investigation follows similar inquiries from German and EU regulators.
-Microsoft maintains the partnership promotes AI innovation and competition.
-OpenAI emphasizes its independence and states Microsoft's board role is non-voting.
Looking Ahead:
-CMA's decision on whether to launch a formal investigation will depend on public feedback.
-Potential remedies could include separation of the companies or limitations on their collaboration.
-The investigation adds to growing global scrutiny of big tech's involvement in AI development.
Microsoft has responded to the CMA's concerns, emphasizing that its partnership with OpenAI, which began in 2019, has maintained the independence of both organizations and has been a catalyst for AI innovation and competition. Brad Smith, Microsoft Vice Chair and President, highlighted the distinction between a non-voting board observer and a full acquisition, citing Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) purchase of DeepMind as a comparative example. Microsoft has committed to cooperating with the CMA to provide necessary information.
This probe by the U.K. regulator is part of a broader international focus on the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership. The scrutiny from the CMA follows a similar examination by Germany’s Federal Cartel Office, which did not find the partnership subject to its merger-control rules but indicated a willingness to re-examine the situation should Microsoft's influence over OpenAI increase. Additionally, the European Union's antitrust watchdog has been closely monitoring the situation, especially in light of Microsoft's role in OpenAI. The CMA's actions underscore its emerging role as a key global tech regulator, particularly evident in its initial blocking and subsequent approval of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) earlier this year.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/nadia-calvino-endorsed-by-eu-ministers-as-next-eib-president-3252825,"Dec 08, 2023","BRUSSELS - European Union finance ministers have endorsed Nadia Calviño as the next president of the European Investment Bank (EIB), set to take office on January 1, following the conclusion of Werner Hoyer's term on December 31. Calviño's vision for the EIB includes a strong commitment to funding green transition projects, rebuilding efforts in Ukraine, and bolstering Europe's global influence.
The endorsement, which occurred today, marks a significant step in the leadership transition at one of Europe's key financial institutions. Calviño, who awaits formal appointment confirmation, has outlined an ambitious agenda that aligns with the EU's strategic priorities in sustainability and international cooperation.
Margrethe Vestager, a prominent figure within the European Commission known for her stringent enforcement against major tech companies, has ceased her candidacy for the EIB presidency. Vestager has been instrumental in levying antitrust penalties and conducting tax investigations against giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Fiat, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX),  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP). Her decision to withdraw from the race allows her to refocus on her role in the Commission ahead of the European Commission elections scheduled for June 6-9, 2024.
Danish Minister Morten Bødskov has expressed support for the new leadership process at the EIB. Meanwhile, Vestager continues to play a crucial role in shaping EU policies and ensuring that institutions like the EIB remain strategic and agile in addressing contemporary challenges.

Ahead of the payrolls report, a string of labor market data this week indicated some softening in the jobs market, while other reports in recent weeks showed a cooling of inflation and led markets to increase expectations the Federal Reserve would have the leeway to cut interest rates as soon as March.  Expectations for a March cut of at least 25 basis points (bps) slipped to about 46%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool, down from about 65% on Thursday.  ""I don't think this gives the Fed the ability to pivot. It's not weak enough,"" said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management in Boston. ""(Fed Chair Jerome) Powell's going to push back on the market's pricing of rate cuts. He's likely to communicate that the Fed's got to stay steady in restrictive territory for the time being.""  Other data from the University of Michigan showed U.S. consumer sentiment improved much more than expected in December, snapping four straight months of declines, as households saw inflation pressures easing. On Wall Street, stocks closed higher after a choppy session with the S&P 500 closing at its highest level since March 2022, led by a 1.1% gain in energy (SPNY) shares as oil prices bounced. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 130.49 points, or 0.36%, to 36,247.87, the S&P 500 gained 18.78 points, or 0.41%, to 4,604.37 and the gained 63.98 points, or 0.45%, to 14,403.97. U.S. Treasury yields surged following the payrolls report. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note jumped 10 basis points to 4.23%, on track for its biggest one-day gain since Nov. 9. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, shot up by 14.5 basis points, its biggest daily jump since June 29, to 4.725%. European shares closed at their highest since February 2022 with the STOXX 600 index up 0.80%. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.29% and was poised for a sixth straight weekly gain, its longest streak in four years.  Along with recent economic data, comments from Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have fueled investor speculation about the timing of the central bank's pivot to a rate cut. The Fed's next policy meeting is on Dec. 12-13, while the next policy announcement from the European Central Bank (ECB) is on Dec. 14. Expectations have also grown the ECB was at or near the end of its rate hike cycle and a cut may be on the horizon.  In currencies, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six currencies, gained 0.29%, to 103.96 while the euro was down 0.29% on the day at $1.0761.  Crude prices bounced after a recent slump but oil benchmarks were on track for a seven-week decline, the longest in five years, after Saudi Arabia and Russia lobbied OPEC+ members to join output cuts.  
U.S. crude settled up 2.73% at $71.23 per barrel and Brent settled at $75.84, up 2.42% on the day. Gold fell 1.27% to $2,002.56 an ounce after dropping to $1,994.49, its lowest since, Nov 24, as the dollar and yields climbed following the payrolls report.",0.8736

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ai-hype-continues-as-googles-gemini-model-fuels-investor-optimism-3251896,"Dec 07, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, saw a significant surge in its stock value following the release of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) model, Gemini. The introduction of Gemini has markedly alleviated apprehensions about Alphabet’s competitive stance in the rapidly evolving AI sector.
On Thursday, Alphabet (GOOG) shares experienced a substantial upswing, marking a notable intraday gain of 6.1% since July. This rally bolstered the company's market capitalization by over $80 billion. In the context of the 2023 stock market, Alphabet's shares have outperformed, showcasing a 55% increase compared to the 46% and 53% gains of the Nasdaq 100 Index and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), respectively. Microsoft, a significant player in AI due to its investment in OpenAI, is seen as a direct competitor in this space.
Market Overview:
-AI optimism has fueled 2023 gains in megacap tech stocks.
-Alphabet's cloud unit, which has been attracting business from AI startups, has seen a strong performance.
-Investors are closely monitoring any sign of weakness or strength in the AI landscape.
Key Points:
-Analysts expressed positive sentiment regarding the Gemini release, with KeyBanc Capital Markets calling it “a flex of years of AI muscle development.”
-Roth MKM expects “negative AI sentiment toward GOOGL to fade quickly leading to an uptick in its valuation multiple.”
-Google is launching three versions of Gemini for various applications:
-Gemini Ultra: The most powerful version, still being safety tested and reviewed.
-Gemini Pro: The midline version, already leveraged for some answers in Bard.
-Gemini Nano: The smallest version, intended for use on smartphones, laptops, and other
local devices.
Looking Ahead:
-The release of Gemini marks a significant step forward for Google in its quest to become a leader in the AI space.
-The model has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, and investors are clearly excited about its potential.
Analysts have positively responded to the Gemini release, with KeyBanc Capital Markets highlighting it as an indication of Alphabet’s sustained AI development efforts. Roth MKM anticipates a swift dissipation of negative AI sentiment towards Alphabet, potentially leading to an enhanced valuation multiple. The AI sector has become a critical factor in driving stock values, particularly among major technology and internet companies. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), both pivotal in AI chip production, have seen their shares surge, with Nvidia more than tripling and AMD climbing over 90% this year.
Alphabet's successful launch of Gemini, comprising its most advanced AI software model to date, has been well-received by the market. The launch of three versions of Gemini, tailored for different applications, further underscores Google's commitment to leading the global AI race.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/alphabet-soars-as-wall-street-cheers-arrival-of-ai-model-gemini-3251797,"Dec 07, 2023","By Aditya Soni (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares ended 5.3% higher on Thursday as Wall Street cheered the launch of Gemini, saying the new artificial intelligence model could help narrow the gap in a race with Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Long considered a leader in AI research, Alphabet lost the spotlight when OpenAI's ChatGPT swept the tech landscape upon its launch in November last year and allowed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to aggressively roll out AI-powered software to businesses. Now, Gemini looks poised to boost Alphabet's AI heft again.  The Google parent said the much-awaited AI system was faster than OpenAI's latest model and can process different forms of media such as video, audio and text. It comes in three versions, each designed to use a different amount of processing power. ""Google is beginning to address investor concerns around generative AI innovation and the high cost of running GenAI models through the combination of Gemini's different model sizes,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said. The company added over $80 billion to its market value. The warm reception contrasted with the nearly $100 billion selloff in Alphabet in February after its Bard chatbot shared inaccurate information in a promotional video and a company event failed to impress. ""Gemini's release comes at an interesting point in time when OpenAI/ChatGPT users have been complaining about how updates to the GPT model family have potentially impacted the quality of its output,"" Macquarie analysts wrote in a note. ""If Google is shipping a GPT-4-beating model, this could help gather user and developer momentum behind Google."" The company has added some of the Gemini technology to its Bard chatbot, and plans to roll out its most advanced version of Gemini through Bard early next year. A six-minute video on the model's abilities showed it could recognize sleight-of-hand magic tricks and help people create art by offering ideas based on materials and their color. MICROSOFT'S AI LEAD  Alphabet has so far trailed Microsoft in the race for AI-driven cloud revenue. In the September quarter, growth at Google Cloud slowed to a near three-year low, paling before the rebound seen at Microsoft Azure. To drive sales of its AI-based offerings, Microsoft has targeted big businesses that already use its software services, while Google has turned to startups, which analysts say have curtailed spending in an uncertain economy. Shares in both the companies have rallied around 50% this year, part of a broader AI-fueled rally in big technology stocks that has driven much of the Nasdaq's gains.  Microsoft currently trades at 30.68 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared with the Google parent's 19.59. 
""Some criticism might be that Google is late to the AI party. (But) they want to get it right and they also obviously see the huge opportunity,"" said Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management in New Jersey.  ""There's different ways to grow your company but one of the best ways is with the same customer base by giving them more solutions or more offerings and that's what I believe this (Gemini) does for Google.""",0.9827

He announced it in a post on X, without revealing anymore details of the launch. Last month, he had said that as soon as Grok was out of early beta testing, it would become available to the subscribers. As more advertisers move away from the microblogging platform, the billionaire has stressed on reducing the company's reliance on advertising and has turned his focus on subscriptions and making them more attractive. He even intends to turn X into a ""super app"", offering a range of services to its subscribers from messaging and social networking to peer-to-peer payments. Musk launched xAI in July in a response to Big Tech's AI efforts, which he has criticized for excessive censorship and a lack of adequate safety measures. 
Large tech companies including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google are racing to launch AI-powered products after OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT caught the imagination of businesses and users globally.

Meanwhile, speculation about a potential shift in Bank of Japan (BOJ) monetary policy drove the yen higher and the dollar lower.
Market Overview:
-The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) rose 1.5%, while the S&P 500 (SPY) halted a three-day decline.
-Optimism surrounding AI drove gains in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)
-The BOJ's hawkish signals sent the yen up 2.5% and the dollar down.
-Recurring jobless claims fell in the US, but concerns remain about a cooling labor market.
Key Points:
-AI is expected to be a major driver of economic growth in 2024 and beyond.
-Investors are betting on potential rate cuts by central banks next year.
-US stocks are vulnerable to any macro shocks due to their optimistic outlook.
-Tesla's (TSLA) Dojo supercomputer project lead has left the company.
-Dish Network (DISH) shares surged after the FCC approved its merger with EchoStar.
-JetBlue (JBLU) boosted its full-year financial outlook on better-than-expected bookings.
-Elon Musk's SpaceX is considering selling insider shares at a valuation of $175 billion.
-ChargePoint shares rose despite a steep revenue drop due to its long-term potential.
Looking Ahead:
-Germany's CPI and Japan's household spending and GDP data are due on Friday.
-The US jobs report and University of Michigan consumer sentiment are also scheduled for Friday.
In the labor market, US jobless benefit claims showed a decline, but they are still near a two-year high, pointing to a cooling labor market. This data, coupled with the anticipation of Friday's jobs report, holds significant implications for future economic and market directions. Despite recent market rallies, analysts caution that stocks are already reflecting an optimistic economic growth outlook, making them vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks.
Bank of America (BAC) quant strategists believe the S&P 500 can continue to rise next year without the sole support of big tech companies. This contrasts with this year's rally, which heavily relied on major tech players. In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) faces a setback in its self-driving technology efforts, while Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) shares surged following FCC approval of its merger with EchoStar Corp. (SATS).

Shares of Alphabet jumped 5.3% as analysts cheered the launch of the Google-parent's newest AI model, while AMD soared nearly 10% after the company estimated the potential market for its data center AI chips could reach $45 billion this year. Other heavyweight tech-related stocks also gained, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) rising over 2%, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) up 1.6% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 1% higher. The Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 2.8%, increasing its 2023 gain to 48%, much of that fueled by bets about the future of AI. ""Today it's an AMD-Google rally. There's a contagion effect across the market. Everyone wants to get on the bandwagon,"" said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Management in New York.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/alphabet-unveils-longawaited-gemini-ai-model-3250768,"Dec 06, 2023","By Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Wednesday introduced its most advanced artificial intelligence model, a technology capable of crunching different forms of information such as video, audio and text. Called Gemini, the Google owner's highly anticipated AI model is capable of more sophisticated reasoning and understanding information with a greater degree of nuance than Google's prior technology, the company said. ""This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we’ve undertaken as a company,"" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post. Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT roughly a year ago, Google has been racing to produce AI software that rivals what the Microsoft-backed company has introduced. Google added a portion of the new Gemini model technology to its AI assistant Bard on Wednesday, and said it planned to release its most advanced version of Gemini through Bard early next year. Alphabet said it is making three versions of Gemini, each of which is designed to use a different amount of processing power. The most powerful version is designed to run in data centers, and the smallest will run efficiently on mobile devices, the company said. Gemini is the largest AI model that the company's Google DeepMind AI unit has helped make, but it is ""significantly"" cheaper to serve to users than the company's prior, larger models, DeepMind Vice President, Product Eli Collins told reporters. ""So it's not just more capable, it's also far more efficient,"" Collins said. The latest model still requires a substantial amount of computing power to train, but Google is improving on its process, he added. 
Alphabet also announced a new generation of its custom-built AI chips, or tensor processing units (TPUs). The Cloud TPU v5p is designed to train large AI models, and is stitched together in pods of 8,960 chips.  The new version of its customer processors can train large language models nearly three times as fast as prior generations. The new chips are available for developers in ""preview"" as of Wednesday, the company said.",0.966

The company also laid out plans to double sales from its loyalty program to $45 billion and increase the user base to 250 million customers by 2027. The program currently has 150 million users, generating over $20 billion in annual system-wide sales.  Despite choppy U.S. consumer spending, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has remained largely unaffected, thanks to its affordable menu items, aggressive promotions and marketing campaigns.  CEO Chris Kempczinski said during the company's investor day he was a little bit wary of making any predictions about next year, because the company has seen the consumer to be ""very resilient.""  McDonald's will open about 7,000 stores in its international developmental licensed markets, which include countries such as China, India, Japan and Brazil, CFO Ian Borden said.  Borden added that more than half of those new stores are planned for China, McDonald's second-largest market, where it recently struck a deal that allows it to have greater control over its business in the region. Globally, the expansion would boost the number of stores to about 50,000 by 2027.  McDonald's ""Best Burger"" initiative aimed at improving the quality of its burgers will also be deployed to nearly all markets by 2026, expanding from about 70 markets currently.  For 2024, McDonald's expects nearly 2% growth in system-wide sales from new restaurants, on a constant currency basis, compared with the 1.5% growth it expects for 2023.  ""It sounds ambitious, but definitely exciting if they can execute it at scale... there's no reason to think that they're not able to achieve this,"" Stephens analyst Joshua Long said. The company also said it was seeing an impact to business across a number of the markets in the Middle East and a limited number of markets outside the region due to the ongoing conflict. 
McDonald's also partnered with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google Cloud to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to its restaurants worldwide, which would give the company more visibility into each store, provide cost savings opportunities and help deliver hotter, fresher food to customers faster. McDonald's shares closed flat on Wednesday. The stock has risen about 8% this year, underperforming the 19% increase in the benchmark S&P 500 index.",0.9875
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/explainerwhat-are-the-eus-landmark-ai-rules-3250910,"Dec 06, 2023","By Martin Coulter LONDON (Reuters) -Negotiations around the European Union's first-of-a-kind rules governing artificial intelligence (AI) looked set for a dramatic climax on Wednesday, as lawmakers enter what some hope will be the final round of discussions on the landmark legislation. What is decided could become the blueprint for other governments as countries seek to craft rules for their own AI industry. Ahead of the meeting, lawmakers and governments could not agree on key issues, including the regulation of fast-growing generative AI and its use by law enforcement. Here's what we know:   HOW DID CHATGPT DERAIL THE AI ACT? The main issue is that the first draft of the law was written in early 2021, almost two years before the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, one of the fastest-growing software applications in history. Lawmakers have scrambled to write regulations even as companies like Microsoft-based OpenAI continue to discover new uses for their technology. OpenAI's founder Sam Altman and computer scientists have also raised the alarm about the danger of creating powerful, high intelligent machines which could threaten humanity. Back in 2021, lawmakers focused on specific use-cases, regulating AI tools based on the task they had been designed to perform and categorised them by risk from minimal to high. Using AI in a number of settings – like aviation, education, and biometric surveillance – was deemed high risk, either as an extension of existing product safety laws, or because they posed a potential human rights threat. The arrival of ChatGPT in November 2022 forced lawmakers to rethink that. This so-called ""General Purpose AI System"" (GPAIS) had not been built with a single use-case in mind, but rather completes all kinds of tasks: engaging in humanlike conversation, composing sonnets, and even writing computer code. ChatGPT and other generative AI tools did not clearly fit into the act's original categories of risk, prompting an ongoing row over how they should be regulated.   WHAT ARE THE PROPOSALS? General purpose AI systems, also known as foundation models, can be built ""on top of"" by developers to create new applications. Researchers have sometimes been caught off-guard by AI's behaviour -- like ChatGPT's habit of ""hallucinating"" false answers, where the underlying model is trained to best predict strings of sentences, but sometimes produces answers that sound convincing, but are in fact false, -- and any underlying quirks buried in a foundation model's code could play out in unexpected ways when deployed in different contexts. EU proposals for regulating foundation models have included forcing companies to clearly document their system's training data and capabilities, demonstrate they have taken steps to mitigate potential risks, and undergo audits conducted by external researchers. In recent weeks, France, Germany and Italy – the EU's most influential countries - have challenged that. The three nations want makers of generative AI models to be allowed to self-regulate, instead of forcing them to comply with hard rules. They say strict regulations will limit European companies' ability to compete with dominant U.S. companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Smaller companies building tools on top of OpenAI code would also face stricter rules, while the providers like OpenAI would not. WHAT IS AT ISSUE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT? Lawmakers are also divided over the use of AI systems by law enforcement agencies for biometric identification of individuals in publicly accessible spaces, sources told Reuters. EU lawmakers want regulation to protect citizens' fundamental rights, but member states want some flexibility for the technology to be used in the interests of national security, by police or border protection agencies, for example. MEPs may drop a proposed ban on remote biometric identification, one source said, if exemptions for its use were limited and clearly-defined.   WHAT IS THE LIKELY OUTCOME? If a final text is agreed on Wednesday, the EU Parliament could theoretically vote the bill into law later this month. Even then, it could be close to two years before it comes into effect. 
Without a final agreement, however, EU lawmakers and governments may instead reach a ""provisional agreement"", with the specifics hammered out in weeks of technical meetings. That risks reigniting longstanding disagreements. They would still have to get a deal ready for a vote in spring. Without that, the law risks being shelved until after Parliamentary elections in June and the 27-member bloc would lose its first-mover advantage in regulating the technology.",0.9787

Shares of online reputation and search platform Yext (NYSE:YEXT)
fell 8.7% in the morning session after the company reported third quarter results with revenue missing Wall Street's estimates. Similarly, its revenue guidance for next quarter underwhelmed. On the other hand, its EPS and free cash flow beat analysts' estimates. During the earnings call, management noted that the selling environment remains challenging, with some deals slipping or downsizing during the later stages of deal cycles. This caused softness in bookings as well as budget pressures on renewals. In addition, it expects a large churn in Q4 attributable to a customer. As a result, the company doesn't expect reacceleration in FY'24 revenues and ARR (recurring revenue) as anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Overall, it was a weaker quarter for Yext, with little reason for investors to stay optimistic. 
As a reminder, Yext ""organizes a business's facts so it can deliver relevant, actionable answers to consumer questions throughout the digital ecosystem."" For example, a new car dealership can easily share information such as addresses, phone numbers, and product details to a broad audience by uploading these details on Yext. These facts are presented in a consistent and accurate manner on multiple platforms such as third-party websites and apps like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Maps. The longer-term threat to a business like this is AI. Does the world need Yext's services less as AI is able to find, organize, and present unstructured data? The stock price move suggests that investors are fearing this very outcome today.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Yext? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.
What is the market telling us:
Yext's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 16 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. 
The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago, when the stock gained 18.4% on the news that the company reported an impressive ""beat and raise"" quarter. First quarter results exceeded analysts' revenue estimates. Similarly, profitability metrics came in strong with gross margin, free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share (EPS) all beating Consensus estimates. Guidance was also strong, with the revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the next quarter exceeding Consensus estimates. Similarly, the full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance beat and were both raised. A slowdown in customer growth was the only minor negative we'd highlight. Regardless, it was a very strong quarter with solid results and impressive guidance that should increase investors' optimism.
Yext is down 10.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $5.66 per share it is trading 58.5% below its 52-week high of $13.65 from June 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Yext's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $364.69.",0.9953

""Our investigation into Meta’s social media platforms demonstrates that they are not safe spaces for children but rather prime locations for predators to trade child pornography and solicit minors for sex,” Torrez said in a statement. He said Meta had enabled ""dozens of adults to find, contact, and press children into providing sexually explicit pictures of themselves or participate in pornographic videos."" Meta in response said it uses sophisticated technology, hires child safety experts, reports content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and shares ""information and tools with other companies and law enforcement, including state attorneys general, to help root out predators."" In August alone, Meta said it disabled more than 500,000 accounts for violating child sexual exploitation policies. Torrez said Zuckerberg and other Meta executives ""are aware of the serious harm their products can pose to young users, and yet they have failed to make sufficient changes to their platforms that would prevent the sexual exploitation of children."" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen on Tuesday announced the state was suing Meta, saying Instagram was ""intentionally designed to be addictive, particularly to minors."" In October, more than 40 U.S. states sued Meta, accusing it of fueling a youth mental health crisis by making their social media platforms addictive. The attorneys general of 33 states including California and New York said Meta repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platforms, and knowingly induced young children and teenagers into addictive and compulsive social media use. Eight other U.S. states and Washington, D.C. filed similar lawsuits.  The cases are the latest in a string of legal actions against social media companies on behalf of children and teens. 
Meta, ByteDance's TikTok and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube already face hundreds of lawsuits filed on behalf of children and school districts about the addictiveness of social media. On Tuesday, U.S. Senators Ed Markey and Bill Cassidy said Meta was intentionally evading a children privacy law and called on the company to halt the practice.",-0.9833
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/governments-spying-on-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-3250447,"Dec 06, 2023","By Raphael Satter WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Unidentified governments are surveilling smartphone users via their apps' push notifications, a U.S. senator warned on Wednesday. In a letter to the Department of Justice, Senator Ron Wyden said foreign officials were demanding the data from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Although details were sparse, the letter lays out yet another path by which governments can track smartphones.  Apps of all kinds rely on push notifications to alert smartphone users to incoming messages, breaking news, and other updates. These are the audible ""dings"" or visual indicators users get when they receive an email or their sports team wins a game. What users often do not realize is that almost all such notifications travel over Google and Apple's servers. That gives the two companies unique insight into the traffic flowing from those apps to their users, and in turn puts them ""in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps,"" Wyden said. He asked the Department of Justice to ""repeal or modify any policies"" that hindered public discussions of push notification spying. In a statement, Apple said that Wyden's letter gave them the opening they needed to share more details with the public about how governments monitored push notifications. ""In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,"" the company said in a statement. ""Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests."" Google said that it shared Wyden's ""commitment to keeping users informed about these requests."" The Department of Justice declined to comment on the push notification surveillance or whether it had prevented Apple or Google from talking about it.  Wyden's letter cited a ""tip"" as the source of the information about the surveillance. His staff did not elaborate on the tip, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed that both foreign and U.S. government agencies have been asking Apple and Google for metadata related to push notifications to, for example, help tie anonymous users of messaging apps to specific Apple or Google accounts.  The source declined to identify the foreign governments involved in making the requests but described them as democracies allied to the United States.  The source said they did not know how long such information had been gathered in that way. 
Most users give push notifications little thought, but they have occasionally attracted attention from technologists because of the difficulty of deploying them without sending data to Google or Apple.  Earlier this year French developer David Libeau said users and developers were often unaware of how their apps emitted data to the U.S. tech giants via push notifications, calling them ""a privacy nightmare.""",0.9514

“Google has abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to another Google product, its comparison shopping service,” the EC declared on Tuesday.
The ruling for a breach of European Union (EU) antitrust rules requires to end the conduct within 90 days or or face penalty payments of up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Google's parent company.
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who heads EU competition policy praised Google’s “many innovative products”, but said that the comparison shopping service wasn’t just about attracting customers by making its product better than rivals.
“Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors,” Vestager claimed.
“It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation,"" she concluded.
Google argues against the ruling, naming Amazon as a competitor
Google’s general counsel Kent Walker responded to the ruling via the company blog.
He explained that users want to find the products they’re looking for quickly and easily.
“We believe the European Commission’s online shopping decision underestimates the value of those kinds of fast and easy connections,” Walker argued.
“While some comparison shopping sites naturally want Google to show them more prominently, our data show that people usually prefer links that take them directly to the products they want, not to websites where they have to repeat their searches,” he explained.
Walker also noted that the EC should consider that many sites that have grown in this period, citing platforms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).
“With its comparison tools, reviews, millions of retailers, and vast range of products from sneakers to groceries, Amazon is a formidable competitor and has become the first port of call for product searches,” Walker stated.
“We compete with Amazon and other sites for shopping-related searches by showing ever more useful product information,” he added.
“Given the evidence, we respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today,” Walker said.
“We will review the Commission’s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” he concluded.

Yext's quarterly revenue was only up 1.9% year on year, which might disappoint some shareholders. On top of that, the company's revenue actually decreased by $1.43 million in Q3 compared to the $3.15 million increase in Q2 2024. Taking a closer look we can a similar revenue decline in the same quarter last year, which could suggest that the business has seasonal elements. Regardless, this situation is worth monitoring as management is guiding for a further revenue drop in the next quarter.
Next quarter's guidance suggests that Yext is expecting revenue to grow 1.6% year on year to $100.3 million, improving on the 1% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 2.9% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement.
Cash Is KingIf you've followed StockStory for a while, you know that we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. Yext burned through $2.33 million of cash in Q3 , increasing its cash burn by 78.4% year on year.
Yext has generated $52.39 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, a solid 13% of revenue. This strong FCF margin stems from its asset-lite business model, giving it optionality and plenty of cash to reinvest in its business.
Key Takeaways from Yext's Q3 Results
Sporting a market capitalization of $876.4 million, Yext is among smaller companies, but its more than $182.2 million in cash on hand and positive free cash flow over the last 12 months puts it in an attractive position to invest in growth.
We struggled to find many strong positives in these results. Although its EPS and free cash flow beat analysts' estimates, its revenue missed Wall Street's estimates and its revenue guidance for next quarter underwhelmed. Overall, this was a mixed quarter for Yext. The company is down 8.7% on the results and currently trades at $6.4 per share.",0.9951
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusivenew-leader-of-gms-cruise-acknowledges-alltime-low-amid-safety-review-3250142,"Dec 05, 2023","By Greg Bensinger (Reuters) -General Motors’ Cruise autonomous vehicle unit has hit an “all time low,” said its new leader, while promising to restore trust with regulators and the public after the company pulled all of its vehicles from U.S. roads. “Our integrity, our competency are being questioned and this really hurts,” said Mo Elshenawy at an all-staff meeting Tuesday, according to a transcript of the call reviewed by Reuters. ""We went from an all-time high to an all-time low and from being an industry leader to temporary pausing all of our operations,” he said.  A spokesperson for Cruise declined comment. Elshenawy was installed as Cruise president last month after its CEO stepped down following regulatory scrutiny after an October accident in which a San Francisco woman was dragged. He said Cruise's approach to developing self-driving cars that were simply better than humans has been ""wrong"" and ""not what the stakeholders are expecting from us.""  ""We now know that we need to be significantly better than human performance and significantly better across a much wider spectrum of use cases and edge cases,"" he said. Cruise has been under growing pressure after regulators said it failed to fully disclose details of the October accident. Last month, Cruise paused all driverless and supervised car trips in the United States and expanded a safety review of its robotaxis and CEO Kyle Vogt and chief product officer Daniel Kan both stepped down. Elshenawy seemed to acknowledge a difficult path ahead for the self-driving car company that competes with Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com’s Zoox. “We don't have a deep reservoir of trust with all of our stakeholders and our regulators,” he said. “This last week a Cruiser shared with me that they don't wear their Cruise jacket in public anymore,"" said Elshenawy. ""It truly breaks my heart.""  Cruise could face $1.5 million in fines and additional sanctions over its failure to disclose details surrounding the Oct. 2 accident in which one of its robotaxis dragged a pedestrian after being struck by another vehicle, a California agency said in a letter last week.  The California Public Utilities Commission ordered Cruise to appear at a Feb. 6 hearing for ""misleading the Commission through omission regarding the extent and seriousness of the accident"" and ""making misleading public comments regarding its interactions with the commission."" The company has hired a law firm to help it conduct a safety review and has pulled all of its vehicles off public U.S. roads in the meantime. Parent GM Monday that the automaker's external review of Cruise's safety will last into the first quarter of 2024. Cruise has said it will conduct layoffs later this month but on Tuesday declined to provide much detail to staff. It has stopped taking questions from staffers at all-hands meetings, previously a fixture.  The company’s chief administrative officer, Craig Glidden, said his focus has been on ""resetting"" the regulatory relationship and ""building trust"" and acknowledged ""we still have a ways to go,"" according to the transcript. ""I intend to work collaboratively with legal and government affairs on all the submissions that we need to make,"" he said. 
Cruise at the meeting said it is reevaluating workers’ compensation structures after suspending a shares buyback program, a decision that caused Vogt to apologize to staff last month. Workers will be eligible for bonuses and promotions in January, an executive said at the meeting. “At GM, we have encountered bigger hurdles than what confronts Cruise today and we've come out a stronger company because of it,” said Glidden, who was an attorney for Cruise’s parent. “I have absolutely no doubt that Cruise will come out a stronger company as well.""",0.9412

Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation into the country’s cloud computing industry in October, following a referral from media regulator Ofcom that highlighted Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft’s dominance of the market. In a letter published on the CMA’s website on Tuesday, Amazon said changes to Microsoft’s terms of services had made it difficult for customers to switch to alternative cloud providers, or run competitors’ services alongside.  “To use many of Microsoft’s software products with these other cloud services providers, a customer must purchase a separate license even if they already own the software,” Amazon said. “This often makes it financially unviable for a customer to choose a provider other than Microsoft.”  Last week, Reuters reported Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had submitted a similar letter to the watchdog, claiming Microsoft’s business practices had left its rivals at an unfair disadvantage. Google made six recommendations to the CMA, including forcing Microsoft to improve interoperability for customers using its Azure service and alongside other cloud programmes, and banning it from withholding security updates from those that switch. 
In its own submission to the CMA, Microsoft said Britain's cloud computing market remained competitive.  ""There are many sources of competition in the cloud market in the UK. Google, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and many other cloud players are also investing billions of pounds in cloud infrastructure globally to satisfy demand and are competing strongly for each customer workload where they operate,"" it wrote.",0.5267

reported results ahead of analysts' expectations in Q3 FY2024, with revenue up 29.8% year on year to $432.9 million. On top of that, next quarter's revenue guidance ($431 million at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 4.1% above what analysts were expecting. It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.96 per share, improving from its profit of $0.23 per share in the same quarter last year.

MongoDB (MDB) Q3 FY2024 Highlights:Revenue: $432.9 million vs analyst estimates of $404 million (7.2% beat)Calculated Billings: $385,5 million vs. analyst estimates of $442.3 million (12.8% miss)EPS (non-GAAP): $0.96 vs analyst estimates of $0.50 (93.5% beat)Revenue Guidance for Q4 2024 is $431 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $414.1 million Free Cash Flow of $34.96 million is up from -$27.3 million in the previous quarterCustomers: 46,400, up from 45,000 in the previous quarter (miss vs. estimates of ~46,870)Gross Margin (GAAP): 75.3%, up from 71.9% in the same quarter last year""MongoDB continued to perform at a high level in the third quarter, as evidenced by 30% revenue growth and better-than-expected profitability. We are pleased by our success in winning new workloads from both new and existing customers across verticals, geographies, and customer segments,"" said Dev Ittycheria, President and Chief Executive Officer of MongoDB.Started in 2007 by the team behind Google’s ad platform, DoubleClick, MongoDB offers database-as-a-service that helps companies store large volumes of semi-structured data.
Data StorageData is the lifeblood of the internet and software in general, and the amount of data created is accelerating. As a result, the importance of storing the data in scalable and efficient formats continues to rise, especially as its diversity and associated use cases expand from analyzing simple, structured datasets to high-scale processing of unstructured data such as images, audio, and video.
Sales GrowthAs you can see below, MongoDB's revenue growth has been impressive over the last two years, growing from $226.9 million in Q3 FY2022 to $432.9 million this quarter.
This quarter, MongoDB's quarterly revenue was once again up a very solid 29.8% year on year. However, its growth did slow down compared to last quarter as the company's revenue increased by just $9.15 million in Q3 compared to $55.51 million in Q2 2024. While we'd like to see revenue increase by a greater amount each quarter, a one-off fluctuation is usually not concerning.
Next quarter, MongoDB is guiding for a 16.2% year-on-year revenue decline to $431 million, a further deceleration from the 35.6% year-on-year decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 16.3% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement.
Customer Growth MongoDB reported 46,400 customers at the end of the quarter, an increase of 1,400 from the previous quarter. That's a little slower customer growth than what we've observed in past quarters, suggesting that the company's customer acquisition momentum is slowing.
Key Takeaways from MongoDB's Q3 Results
Sporting a market capitalization of $30.18 billion, more than $1.92 billion in cash on hand, and positive free cash flow over the last 12 months, we believe that MongoDB is attractively positioned to invest in growth.
We enjoyed seeing MongoDB exceed analysts' revenue expectations this quarter. However, calculated billings (revenue + change in deferred revenue) missed. Customer count also missed and growth of this key metric slowed. Next quarter and full year revenue and non-GAAP operating income guidance came in higher than Wall Street's estimates. Overall, we think this was a mixed quarter. The market was likely expecting more, and the stock is down 7.6% after reporting, trading at $400.94 per share.",0.9981

Advertising revenue could suffer in the quarter following an advertiser exodus earlier this year due to ads placed next to questionable content. Ad revenue represented about 87% of total revenue in Q2.  Cost-per-click is how much advertisers pay Google for each user click. The number dropped 23% in Q2 due to increased mobile search use since mobile ads cost less.  Traffic acquisition costs (TAC) or what the company pays to get people to click ads. TAC in last year’s quarter totaled $4.18B with analysts expecting around $5.24B today.  ”Google other revenues” is a category containing app sales, Google Cloud, hardware sales – basically, anything that isn’t ad money. Analysts are predicting $3.43B, which would mark an over 41% growth on the quarter.  Don’t confuse the above category with the broader “Other Bets” catchall.

According to court documents filed on Monday, the Justice Department said it ""no longer requires assistance from Apple, Inc."" mandated by a February court order, which compelled the company to provide support to federal agents in their investigation into a mass shooting in December that claimed the lives of 14 civilians. As part of the investigation, the Justice Department asked Apple to help the FBI unlock an iPhone 5c which belonged to Syed Farook, one of two shooters accused of perpetrating the attacks. 
The story was initially reported by USA Today on Monday evening. 
The Justice Department's actions came days after reports from Reuters surfaced that Cellebrite, an Israeli forensic software company, developed innovative decryption technology in order to gain access into Farook's phone. In the days since, officials from Cellebrite refused to confirm or deny the reports. Last week, attorneys from the Justice Department asked a U.S. federal court to delay a hearing after court filings indicated that an ""outside party"" developed the means to unlock the phone. 
The highly-publicized case has garnered significant media attention in recent weeks, reigniting a longstanding debate on the importance of individual privacy versus national security interests. Apple CEO Tim Cook lambasted the Justice Department for filing the suit, describing any order by the government that forced the company to develop software for hacking into its own technology as the ""software equivalent of cancer.""
Cook received the backing from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), as well as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc C (NASDAQ:GOOG), and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) in the controversial case. 
""While the government can in some circumstances require private parties to support law-enforcement investigations...law enforcement may not commandeer innocent third parties into becoming its undercover agents, its spies, or its hackers,"" the ACLU wrote in an amicus brief last month. ""If the government prevails, then this case will be the first of many requiring companies to degrade the security and to undermine the trust in their products so essential to privacy in the digital age.""

The central government, which has sent thousands of police reinforcements to stop people voting and has attempted to dismantle the infrastructure needed to conduct the referendum it says is illegal, insisted it would not go ahead. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont told Reuters in an interview, however: ""Everything is prepared at the more than 2,000 voting points so they have ballot boxes and voting slips, and have everything people need to express their opinion.""  Bands played at a closing rally for the referendum campaign in Barcelona where people constructed the slogan ""Referendum is democracy"" in big white letters on a stage in front of a cheering crowd, many draped in the red-and-yellow Catalan flag. People preparing to camp out in polling stations in order to defy court orders to close them were also in high spirits. At one Barcelona school, Hector, a 43-year-old local, said five or six families would be spending the night. ""We want to make sure the school is open for activities and at night when they might come to clear us out or empty it, there will be families sleeping or people in the street,"" he said, adding that they planned to play ping-pong and cook a fideua seafood dish on Saturday. The head of the Catalan regional police ordered officers to evacuate and close polling stations by 6 a.m. on Sunday, before the voting is due to open at 9 a.m.  In an internal memo published by La Vanguardia newspaper, the police chief said force should be used only as a last resort. ""At all times, before using force, you must take into account what might be the consequences of this police action and avoid the escalation of this situation, especially when there are children, elderly or other vulnerable people amongst the crowd,"" the document, whose authenticity was confirmed by a police spokeswoman, said. ""PEACEFUL RESISTANCE"" So far, the Catalan police, known as the Mossos, a force that is held in affection in the region, particularly after the Islamist attacks in August, have shown a friendly face. ""The Mossos have come to see what we are doing and they've seen we're having a party,"" said 45-year-old Ferran Taberner who was at the school with his daughter. ""If it gets complicated we'll stay inside peacefully and they won't move us.""  Organizers said 60,000 people had registered to participate in the mass school sleepover which they say will show ""peaceful resistance"", even if they are prevented from voting. ""I don't believe there will be anyone who will use violence or who will want to provoke violence that will tarnish the irreproachable image of the Catalan independence movement as pacifist,"" Puigdemont said. At a news conference, regional officials displayed one of the white plastic ballot boxes bearing the crest of the regional government. Puigdemont has said more than 6,000 were being kept in a secret place. Police have confiscated thousands of voting slips, and courts have fined and threatened to arrest regional officials. Catalonia's High Court ordered Google (O:GOOG) to delete a smartphone application that the Catalan government was using to spread information about the vote. A company spokeswoman said Google removes content when it receives a court order. Madrid, which claims the authority of a constitution that declares the country to be indivisible, remained implacably opposed to the vote, but also expressed the hope Sunday would be peaceful. ""I insist that there will be no referendum on Oct. 1,"" government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said, adding that organizers would face criminal charges for trying to hold it. In a sign that large crowds are expected on the streets on Sunday, department store chain El Corte Ingles said it would shut three stores in central Barcelona. The central government said airspace above the city would be partly restricted.

The analysts pointed to several challenges faced by the tech giant, including a slowdown in its cloud business and significant expenses related to YouTube's streaming rights for the NFL Sunday Ticket.
They highlighted that Google Cloud's growth deceleration has now extended to four quarters, lagging behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS), which saw a slowdown over six quarters. He predicts that Alphabet's cloud division will only see a 21% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which is three percentage points below the consensus.
The analysts also noted rising legal costs that have not been fully factored into Wall Street's projections. These costs exceeded $600 million in the third quarter and are expected to climb further. Additionally, the NFL Sunday Ticket deal appears to be a financial burden for Alphabet, with half of its $1.8 billion annual cost being recognized in the fourth quarter. The subscriber revenues, coming from users paying $350 annually, are estimated at around $263 million, resulting in an anticipated loss of $638 million for the period.
Furthermore, they cautioned that current optimism might overlook necessary investments in infrastructure to support advancements in cloud services and artificial intelligence at Alphabet. Mizuho estimates that these factors will lead to an operating margin of 27.5% for Alphabet, which is one full percentage point below consensus expectations.

Researchers around the world are trying to perfect quantum computing, which relies on quantum mechanics to reach computing speeds far faster than classical silicon-based computers. The challenge has been to create quantum computers that are reliable enough in the real world to consistently beat conventional computers. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and China's Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) , along with startups and nation states, are all racing to develop quantum machines. As quantum researchers have made the machines big enough to outpace classical computers, they have struggled with data errors. On Monday,  IBM  showed what it says is a new way of connecting chips together inside machines and then connecting machines together which, when combined with a new error-correction code, could produce compelling quantum machines by 2033. The first machine to use them is called Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) System Two, which uses three ""Heron"" chips. Dario Gil, IBM's senior vice president and director of research, said that progress will appear fairly steady until 2029, when the full effect of the error-correction technologies come into play. After that, the machines should see a sharp uptick in capabilities, similar to how AI systems that developed slowly for the past 15 years became vastly more sophisticated over the past year. 
""You're going to have to tie them together,"" Gil said of IBM's newest chips. ""You're going to have to do many of these things together to be practical about it. Because if not, it's just a paper exercise."" IBM is not the only quantum player targeting machines within the next few years. Startup PsiQuantum, which is working with GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) to make its chips, told Reuters earlier this year it plans to have a commercial machine within six years.",0.923

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) upgraded its rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $180, arguing expectations for a decline in tech giant's hardware sales are somewhat overly negative. Apple's share price rose 3.3%.
The bank's price target on Apple's stock assumes flat hardware and somewhat-slower-than-historical growth in services. Bank of America said the 26% pullback seen in Apple's stock price from its peak ""presents opportunity"" and highlighted several supportive factors for its bullish outlook including a ""large reversal of inventory overhang"" for iPhones, stability in the group's global supply chain and ""modest"" acceleration in services revenue growth.

Instagram Stories produced about $750 million in advertising revenue in 2018 and could pave the way to grow to $2.2 billion this year and $7.5 billion by 2021, Nomura said.

The prospective power underlines a European Commission push for a speedier and a more effective antitrust capability and came after a decade-long battle with Google (O:GOOG) which rivals said has not resulted in any effective changes. The new initiative would be similar to one introduced by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority three years ago which subsequently led to a shake-up of the UK audit market following an investigation. The Commission said the new power aims to address gaps in existing competition rules and to intervene against structural competition problems across markets in a timely way. ""After establishing a structural competition problem through a rigorous market investigation during which rights of defense are fully respected, the new tool should allow the Commission to impose behavioral and where appropriate, structural remedies,"" the EU executive said.

The new effort could target industries ranging from tech to beverages to digital agriculture.

1. Amazon Slips, but Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Intel Shine
Today’s big postmarket earnings should help the market tomorrow, although Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) seeing red in after-hours trading could be a hindrance.
Amazon’s earnings missed expectations as operating expenses jumped and the company also warned on third-quarter operating income.
But Google parent Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares jumped sharply following a quarterly report that beat on the top and bottom lines.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) should help the chip sector tomorrow as it climbed on the back of solid numbers, fuelled by demand for its data center chips and high-performance products.
And Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) also impressed investors, with comparable-store sales beating forecasts.
2. U.S. Economy Expected to Show Signs of Slowing 
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will report its preliminary reading on second-quarter GDP at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT) tomorrow.
Economists, on average, expect the economy slowed to a pace of 1.8% in the second quarter from the 3.1% rate seen in the previous quarter.
But some analysts appear more optimistic on the pace of economic growth.
""We forecast GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% in 2Q19, led by strong contributions from consumer spending and government expenditures (see 2Q19 GDP Forecast). In part, historical data that is about to be revised contribute to this forecast,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note.
While GDP will rightfully take the spotlight, consumer confidence will also get at least a cursory look.
The University of Michigan releases its preliminary measure of July consumer sentiment at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Consumer sentiment is expected to tick up slightly to 98.8, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
3. Twitter Readies Earnings 
The tech earnings parade continues Friday, with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) set to release second-quarter earnings before markets open.
Twitter is expected to report a profit of 18 cents per share, according to Investing.com, on revenue of $829 million.
As well as its earnings and guidance, average monetizable daily active users (mDAU) will be one of the closely watched metrics after the company reported an 11% rise to 134 million in the first quarter.
The social media company's report comes against a mixed backdrop for social media companies as user growth has been steady, but the threat of regulatory scrutiny is on the rise.

At 11:00AM ET (15:00GMT), the Dow Jones advanced 11 points, or 0.05%, the S&P 500 was unchanged, while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 17 points, or 0.27%.
Putting pressure on the tech sector, the European Commission (EC) fined Google’s parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) a record €2.42 billion ($2.7 billion) Tuesday for a breach of antitrust laws.
“Google has abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to another Google product, its comparison shopping service,” the EC declared on Tuesday.
The firm’s general counsel Kent Walker responded that the they disagree with the ruling and cited Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a competitor.
“We will review the Commission’s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” he concluded.
Also dampening market sentiment on Tuesday, the IMF cut its growth forecasts for the U.S. economy to 2.1% in 2017 and 2018, dropping its assumption that the Trump administration's tax cut and fiscal spending plans would boost growth.
Limiting losses on Tuesday, consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in June, bolstering optimism over the consumption driven economy.
Still on the docket, market players looked ahead to a speech from Fed chair Janet Yellen.
Scheduled to speak on global economic issues at 1:00PM ET (17:00GMT) Tuesday, markets hope for that Yellen would provide new insight on the timing of when the Fed will next raise interest rates and/or begin the reduction of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
Earlier Tuesday, San Francisco Fed president John Williams warned that the U.S. and other advanced economies would find themselves stuck in a long-term slow growth period if fiscal authorities didn’t take action.
Investors will also hear Philadelphia Fed chief Patrick Harker speak on the economic outlook at 11:15AM ET (15:15GMT), while Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari will participate in a townhall at 5:30PM ET (21:30GMT).
Despite the Fed’s own median projection that it will raise rates once more this year, markets put the odds at just 41% for a hike in December, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Meanwhile, oil rose for a fourth consecutive session on Tuesday, after five straight weeks of declines, as prices were boosted by a weaker dollar and investors covering short positions, despite continued consider over rising U.S. shale production.
Still ahead, industry group the American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly report on U.S. crude inventories at 4:30PM ET (2030GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 2.2 million barrels.

A sampling of opinions from hearing observers suggests Facebook acquitted itself well in answers; Twitter, less so.
While a number of views were aired, Bloomberg notes Democrats on the panel tended to push for more responsibility and transparency from the companies in monitoring and disclosing misleading posts and ads, while several Republicans fretted the effect on free speech if Silicon Valley started censoring news content.

WhatsApp founder Jan Koum will receive nearly $2 billion in stock, vesting over a four-year period, as an inducement for him to stay with the company, according to a regulatory filing on Monday.
The acquisition, which Facebook announced in February and recently received regulatory approval in Europe, underscores the sky-rocketing values of fast-growing Internet startups, and the willingness of established players such as Facebook and Google Inc (O:GOOGL) (O:GOOG) to pay out for them.
WhatsApp, which has more than 600 million monthly users, is among a new crop of mobile messaging and social media apps that have become increasingly popular among younger users. Snapchat, a privately owned mobile app that allows users to swap photos that can disappear after a few seconds, is raising money at a $10 billion valuation, according to media reports.
Facebook paid $4.59 billion in cash and 178 million shares of its stock for WhatsApp, as well 46 million of grants in restricted stock units for WhatsApp employees that will vest over a four year period. At Monday's opening Facebook share price of $77.17, the deal translates to roughly $21.8 billion.
Koum, who will serve as WhatsApp Chief Executive and become a Facebook director, will earn a $1 annual salary, similar to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. Koum will receive 24.9 million Facebook restricted stock units, worth roughly $1.9 billion at Monday's share price.

WhatsApp, which has more than 70 employees, will continue to be based at its Mountain View, California, location.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-tuesday-499547,"Jun 27, 2017","Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, June 27:
1. Markets await comments from Fed Chair Yellen
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is due to speak about global economic issues at the British Academy's 2017 President's Lecture in London at 1:00PM ET (1700GMT). Audience questions are expected.
Her comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy and the timing of when the Fed will next raise interest rates. The Fed chair could be asked about the U.S. central bank's plan to start shrinking its massive balance sheet, which ballooned to $4.5 trillion in wake of the financial crisis.
Besides Yellen, a pair of Fed policymakers are due to make public appearances on Tuesday that may offer further insight into the debate among policymakers on the likelihood of higher interest rates in the months ahead.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker is set to speak about the economic outlook and international trade at the European Economics & Financial Centre, in London, while Minneapolis Fed Chief Neel Kashkari will speak at a town hall event in Michigan.
Futures traders are pricing in less than a 15% chance of a hike at the Fed's September meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a December increase was seen at about 35%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, edged down almost 0.5% to 96.64 in early New York trade, its lowest since June 15.
2. Hawkish Draghi sends euro to 2-week highs
The euro rose to the day’s highs after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said there are clear signs of a “strengthening and broadening” recovery underway in the euro zone area.
Draghi said the ECB sees growth that is above trend and well distributed across the euro area, but reiterated that “a considerable degree” of stimulus is still needed in the euro zone, and that the ECB must be “prudent” in how it unwinds it.
He added that the factors weighing on the path of inflation were mainly temporary, adding that deflationary forces are being replaced by inflationary ones.
The comments came during the keynote speech at the ECB’s central banking forum in Portugal.
The euro rose around 0.6% against the dollar to trade at 1.1253, the highest level since June 14 (EUR/USD). The euro was also higher against the yen and the pound, with EUR/GBP advancing 0.4% to 0.8824 and EUR/JPY gaining 0.4% to 125.59.
3. BoE orders banks to boost capital
The Bank of England has told British banks they will have to set aside more than £11 billion in extra capital to cover potential losses in the event of a financial downturn.
In its financial stability report released earlier, the BoE raised the counter-cyclical capital buffer rate to 0.5% from zero, which means that lenders must set aside 0.5% of their assets as capital to cover potential losses if the economy weakens.
Speaking following the release of the report, BoE Governor Mark Carney said raising buffer rates along with recent MPC action will support the U.K. economy during the period of heightened uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations.
The pound was slightly higher against the dollar at 1.2735 (GBP/USD).
4. Oil rises for 4th day in a row
Oil futures advanced, putting crude on track for its fourth up session in a row, as investors looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on stockpiles of crude and refined products.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (2030GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 2.2 million barrels.
U.S. crude was at $43.80 a barrel, up 42 cents, or around 1%, while Brent oil tacked on 55 cents, or 1.2%, to $46.59 a barrel.
5. EU slaps Google with record €2.4 billion fine
The European Commission has fined Google €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) for breaching EU antitrust rules after regulators concluded the first stage of their three-pronged probe into the world's most popular search engine.
The fine, which targets the company's shopping business, is the largest doled out by Brussels for a monopoly abuse case and follows a seven-year-long investigation into Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) practices.
Investigations were triggered after the European Commission received dozens of complaints from U.S. and European competitors, who claimed that the company abused its search market dominance to give its Google Shopping service an advantage over other retailers and create a monopoly over consumers.

The blue-chip Dow futures fell 25 points, or 0.12%, at 7:11AM ET (11:11GMT), the S&P 500 futures lost 4 points, or 0.15%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 27 points, or 0.47%.
Hitting headlines prior to the U.S. market open, the European Commission (EC) fined Google a record €2.42 billion ($2.7 billion) Tuesday for a breach of antitrust laws.
“Google has abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to another Google product, its comparison shopping service,” the EC declared on Tuesday.
The firm’s general counsel Kent Walker responded that the they disagree with the ruling and cited Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a competitor.
“We will review the Commission’s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” he concluded.
Shares in Google’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc C (NASDAQ:GOOG) were off around 1% in pre-market trade.
On the economic front, investors will focus on the publication of the Conference Board's consumer confidence for June at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT).
Market players also looked ahead to a speech from Fed chair Janet Yellen.
Scheduled to speak on global economic issues at 1:00PM ET (17:00GMT) Tuesday, markets hope for any new insight on the timing of when the Fed will next raise interest rates and/or begin the reduction of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
Earlier Tuesday, San Francisco Fed president John Williams warned that the U.S. and other advanced economies would find themselves stuck in a long-term slow growth period if fiscal authorities didn’t take action.
Investors will also hear Philadelphia Fed chief Patrick Harker speak on the economic outlook at 11:15AM ET (15:15GMT), while Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari will participate in a townhall at 5:30PM ET (21:30GMT).
Tuesday’s session was replete with input from global central bankers as European Central Bank (ECB) governor Mario Draghi gave an upbeat view of the euro zone’s strengthening recovery and reflationary pressures, but insisted that accommodative monetary policy should be maintained.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England’s (BoE) financial stability report suggested that banks needed to set aside more capital, although it considered the overall risks from the domestic U.K. environment to be at a “standard level”.
But BoE governor Mark Carney noted that there are some risks that require particular vigilance, including consumer credit and Brexit.
Meanwhile, oil rose for a fourth consecutive session on Tuesday, after five straight weeks of declines, as prices were boosted by a weaker dollar and investors covering short positions, despite continued consider over rising U.S. shale production.
Still ahead, industry group the American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly report on U.S. crude inventories at 4:30PM ET (2030GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 2.2 million barrels.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-friday-1935765,"Jul 26, 2019","Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, July 26:
1. Slowdown expected for American economy
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will report its preliminary reading on second-quarter GDP at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) Friday, with annualized growth forecast to slow to 1.8%, the weakest reading in more than two years, from 3.1% in the first three months of the year.
The slowdown - which comes amid a 10-year economic expansion, the longest in history - is partly a reflection of inventory management around the introduction of new tariffs on Chinese imports, the sharpest illustration of the trade conflict that has hit global growth. That backdrop has fed expectations that the Federal Reserve will step in next week with a quarter-point cut to interest rates.
A worse-than-expected number could drive U.S. stocks higher as markets would interpret the reading as ammunition for the Fed to ease policy more aggressively.
A much stronger-than-expected rise in durable goods orders released on Thursday diminished the odds for a larger 50 basis-point cut on July 31 to just above 20%. Following July’s expected reduction, Fed funds futures have priced in additional 25 basis point cuts in both September and December.

2. Alphabet, Intel wow while Amazon disappoints; Starbucks jumps
Quarterly earnings released after Thursday's market close will be priced in, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) set to boost techs, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) missed the mark.
Alphabet's shares soared more than 8% in premarket trade following a quarterly report that beat on the top and bottom lines and included a $25 billion buyback. The tech giant also eased investor concerns over increased regulatory scrutiny, saying that it was nothing it hadn’t seen before.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares jumped 5% after it reported solid numbers and an increased revenue forecast, both of which bode well for other chipmakers.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was the exception to the positive news, with shares off 1.5%, as profit missed consensus and the company warned on third-quarter operating income.
Outside of tech, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) delivered as comparable sales beat estimates and the company raised its annual profit forecast. Shares soared more than 6%.
3. Twitter, McDonald’s to take up earnings baton
Earnings season has yet to reach the halfway mark with only 42% of S&P 500 firms having so far released quarterly numbers as of Thursday’s close. 76% of those companies have beaten profit expectations with average growth of 5.5% while 63% have topped sales estimates with 4.7% growth, according to The Earnings Scout.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) will pick up the earnings baton for tech companies as it reports ahead of the open.
Average monetizable daily active users (mDAU) will be one of the closely-watched metrics after the company reported an 11% rise to 134 million in the first quarter.
Markets will also be on the alert for any reflection of rising regulatory risk in its guidance.
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) will be in the spotlight as the only Dow company to report ahead of the bell, with market focus centered on same-store sales.
4. Apple confirms $1 billion purchase of Intel’s modem business
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) confirmed reports that it was on its way to becoming self-reliant in smartphone chips as it picked up the majority of Intel’s modem business in a deal valued at $1 billion.
Modem chips connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has always relied on outside suppliers for the part.
The deal with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will bolster Apple's goal to make its own modem chip, closing a gap with two of its biggest global rivals - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Huawei - that already source those components internally.
5. U.S. futures receive boost from earnings ahead of GDP
Mostly upbeat earnings reports were sufficient to return risk appetite to U.S. markets with tech shares leading gains. Wall Street took a dip on Thursday, with blame attributed to the better-than-forecast durable goods orders that dented arguments for aggressive Fed action.
The GDP data will likely be the final piece of the puzzle to fit into speculation over just how dovish the Fed will be next week, and focus may well fall on U.S. President Donald Trump’s Twitter account, given the pressure he has already exerted on the central bank through that channel.
Trump has criticised the Fed for raising rates too fast last year and not recognizing the need for faster easing now, arguing that economic growth would be much higher and the “very misguided” central bank should “move now”.
Trump’s last tweet on Thursday announced the expected passage of the budget deal.

Chip stocks rose after news that White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow is hosting a meeting with semiconductor and software executives on Monday to discuss the U.S. ban on sales to China's Huawei. 
Equifax (NYSE:EFX) rose 0.9% despite reports that it will pay $700 million to settle various federal and state investigations into a 2017 data breach that exposed the personal data of nearly 150 million Americans.
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) surged 7% after posting strong earnings, while Micron (NASDAQ:MU) jumped 2.5% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) lifted its stock to buy from neutral. 
Elsewhere, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) lost 2.7%, while AT&T (NYSE:T) was down 1.2% and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) slipped 0.3%

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-things-under-the-radar-this-week-1878674,"May 25, 2019","Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Growth Stocks Back in Fashion?
The ""smart money"" has spoken. Bets on growth stocks are once again fashionable. But cyclical stocks are out.
Following the first-quarter cyclical rally, hedge funds cut their exposure toward energy, materials and industrials by 250 basis points and scooped up growth favorites like consumer discretionary and communication services, according to a report from Goldman Sachs, citing the latest quarterly fund filings.
The rotation saw consumer discretionaries become the largest net overweight tilt for the first time since 2015, Goldman said. Tech, meanwhile, still reigned supreme, accounting for 18% of hedge fund net exposure, the most of any sector.
Many will be quick to point out that hedge funds are becoming less relevant in the investment community, with returns that continue to undershoot the broader market and fail to justify the traditional 2-and-20 free structure (2% annual fee and 20% fee on profits above a certain level).
But the trillions of dollars they manage means their role in the broader market shouldn’t be underestimated.
The average equity hedge fund has returned 8% in 2019, supported by the outperformance of fund favorites such as FAANG stocks Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)), Goldman reported.
But that’s well shy of the S&P 500, which has delivered more than 12.7% year to date.
Among the top names at hedge funds as of the end of the first quarter were the FAANGs, with Amazon, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) representing three of the top five largest positions, according to Goldman.
The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLK) is up more than 20% year to date, though the deepening trade war between the U.S. and China has seen the NYSE FANG+ index sliding more than 11% since May 6, when the Trump administration announced it will ratchet up tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Yet Wall Street analysts are wary of declaring that FAANG's ride higher is at risk.
“I don’t think FAANG is dead,” Kristina Hooper, Invesco’s chief global markets strategist, said on Yahoo Finance's “The First Trade.” “But it makes sense that it’s taking a pause.”
“We have to recognize that there’s an economic policy uncertainty story here, which is the longer these trade wars go on, we’re likely to see (capital expenditure) go down.""
2. Faux Meat Could be a $140 Billion Market
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) shares ended the week lower, but it’s still one of the hottest IPOs in recent memory.
And the segment has huge potential, according to a research note Barclays Equity Research issued this week.
“We estimate that the market for alternative meat can reach (about) $140 billion over the next ten years, with alternative meat players capturing (about) 10% of the (approximately) $1.4 trillion global meat industry, based on our analysis,” Barclays said.
It did highlight risk factors “such as alternative meat products being less healthy than claimed as a result of high salt levels or potential regulatory requirements that restrict marketing” and the “inherent barriers” to replacing favorite foods like T-bone steaks.
But there are enough substitution opportunities for the alternative meat sector to grab its fair share of global market.
Barclays even managed to squeeze in a reference to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
“While we see some parallels to electric vehicle companies' disruption of the car industry, we believe that the ultimate market opportunity for plant-based (and perhaps lab-based) protein is potentially even larger given the mainstream appeal of affordable food products relative to the current high-end, niche audience targeted by electric vehicle manufacturers,” it said.
“With that said, we believe taste and price will ultimately dictate whether or not alternative meat gains widespread acceptance,” Barclays added.
3. AI Will Spur Merger Boom and New Markets
As artificial intelligence progresses it will create a boom in corporate deals and also entirely new markets, according to one economist who’s been at the forefront of the tech sector.
In an interview highlighted by the Richmond Fed this week, economist R. Preston McAfee compared AI to innovations like electricity and the automobile, which fundamentally change the way things are done.
McAfee, who after his academic career joined Yahoo as chief economist in 2007, before moving on the Google and then Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), told the Richmond Fed some tech companies will use AI to push into new businesses, while existing companies will fight back and also move into other areas.
“You'll … get the creation of completely new markets,” he said. “Some of those markets are likely to be ones in which a single firm becomes dominant. Digital commerce was an example of this; there was a period when there were lots of companies in digital commerce, but Amazon has clearly stepped out as the leader.”
In addition, merger and acquisition booms, with the exception of the ‘80s one prompted by deregulation, are spurred by disruptive technologies, McAfee said.
“Such merger waves arise as firms struggle to change their business model, due to the changing environment the technological change brought about, and purchase new capabilities via merger,” he added. “I expect to see a large merger wave from AI, lasting a decade or more, that could change competition in many or even most sectors.”
Antitrust concerns should be lessened with Google, Microsoft, Amazon and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) all major vendors in AI, he added.",0.9929

The total number of ads, or paid clicks, expanded by 17 percent in the third quarter. That was down from the 25 percent growth rate that Google delivered in the second quarter.
But online advertising rates, which have been mired in a multi-year decline, moderated slightly in the third quarter, declining 2 percent year-on-year. That marked an improvement from the 6 percent decline in ""cost-per-click"" or CPCs in the second quarter.
Shares of Google fell 2.7 percent to $510.11 in extended trading on Thursday.
""The CPC decline abated. That's a big positive,"" argued BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. ""If CPCs flatline that's going to help the core meaningfully.""
Google posted $16.52 billion in revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to $13.75 billion in the year ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were looking for revenue of $16.57 billion in the latest quarter.
Google ramped up its spending during the quarter. The company increased its headcount by roughly 3,000 employees, contributing to a 46 percent rise in research and development costs.

On Thursday, Google announced it had appointed Omid Kordestani its new chief business officer, replacing Nikesh Arora, who had departed a quarter ago to join Japan's Softbank Corp (T:9984). The chief business officer is considered a key position, overseeing all the company's revenue-generating activities and serving as a liaison to investors and Wall Street.

Six-year-old Flurry uses analytics to help target ads at consumers by monitoring activity on more than half a million apps on some 1.4 billion mobile devices around the world, Yahoo said in a statement on Monday.
The startup provides information to help marketers and brands more easily reach their desired audiences, Yahoo said.
Yahoo did not cite a price tag, but a source familiar with the matter said the Internet company is paying several hundred million dollars. Tech blog re/code earlier reported that rough amount.
Flurry will operate much as before after the acquisition closes, and its team will remain in their current locations, Yahoo added.
Yahoo is trying to revitalize a stagnant online advertising business as Chief Executive Marissa Mayer marks her second anniversary at the Internet company.
The former Google executive has revamped many of Yahoo's Web products but its ad sales are still weak while rivals such as Google and Facebook continue to post strong, double-digit revenue growth.
Like its rivals, it has been investing in its mobile advertising platform, as users increasingly access the Internet from smartphones and tablets. Its mobile advertising revenue more than doubled in the second quarter.

But mobile advertising typically commands lower rates than online. Revenue in Yahoo's display advertising business decreased 8 percent to $436 million in the second quarter.
The average price per ad decreased 24 percent, while the number of display ads sold increased 24 percent.

Deutsche Wohnen (DE:DWNG) has bought 700 flats on Karl Marx Allee, a sweeping boulevard of monumental Stalinist architecture that was one of the flagship building projects of the former German Democratic Republic after World War Two. Deutsche Wohnen owns around 110,000 flats in the Berlin area and has been the focus of much ire over rising rents. Tenant groups want to gather 170,000 signatures needed within four months to hold a referendum with the aim of expropriating Deutsche Wohnen's property. The seven- to nine-story apartment blocks flanking Karl Marx Allee, named after the German political philosopher who wrote ""The Communist Manifesto"" and ""Das Kapital"", were built between 1952 and 1960 in the socialist wedding-cake style. Protesters against the sale have hung banners from one apartment silo reading ""Kommerz Allee fuer 28 Million Verhoekert An Deutsche Wohnen"" (""Capitalist Avenue - flogged to Deutsche Wohnen for 28 Million""). A spokeswoman for Deutsche Wohnen said the company planned to keep the apartments in its portfolio and that existing rental contracts would be valid.  For decades, residents enjoyed comparably cheap housing. But over the past decade, ultra-low interest rates, foreign investment and an influx of some 40,000 people to the capital each year have thrust up living costs. Rents have more than doubled since 2008, according to a recent study by online housing portal immowelt.de. In April, some 10,000 people took to the streets of Berlin to protest about rising housing costs. Last month Google (O:GOOG) shelved plans to convert a former electrical substation in the trendy Kreuzberg district into a campus following months of anti-gentrification protests. Concern about a shortage of affordable housing prompted Berlin's mayor in August to say the state was considering barring foreign investors from buying real estate in the capital in a bid to cool the property market. The Berlin government has introduced measures to try and curb rising rents including expanding areas that are covered by anti-speculation laws that allow the state to block private sales in favor of state-owned companies.  
The district of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg is considering whether to execute its first right of refusal to buy one of the four apartment blocks, a spokeswoman said.",-0.0525
"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/u.s.-cap-first-positive-week-of-2016-as-crude-rally-bolsters-dow,-nasdaq-381360","Jan 22, 2016","Investing.com -- U.S. stocks capped their first positive week of the year with a stellar session on Friday, as crude futures surged by more than $2 a barrel, providing some reassurance for investors that a prolonged oil rout may be nearing its conclusion.
On Friday, crude futures settled above $32 a barrel after surging by more than 8% on the session. The bounce off near 12-year lows took place amid heavy short covering from traders, as prominent energy officials from OPEC members such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela offered strong hints that the global economy may be unable to absorb oil prices at their current level.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 210.83 or 1.33% to close at 16,093.51, while the NASDAQ Composite index surged 119.12 or 2.66% to 4,591.18, as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) provided a boost to both indices. Despite Friday's rally, the Dow remains down by more than 7% on the new year while the NASDAQ has fallen approximately 11% over the last six months. The S&P 500 Composite index, meanwhile, gained 37.91 or 2.03% to 1,906.90, as all 10 sectors closed in the green. Stocks in the Energy, Telecommunications and Technology industries led, each rising by more than 2%.
The top performer on the Dow was Apple (O:AAPL), which soared 5.12 or 5.32% to 101.42, ahead of its fourth quarter earnings release early next week. Investors are bracing for weak sales among Apple's tablets and iPhone 6 models over the last quarter. The soft revenues could be offset by hints from the world's largest company on the timing of its iPhone 7 release, which many analysts expect to hit markets in September. Shares in Apple were bolstered by a report from Bloomberg that Alphabet Inc C (O:GOOG) paid the tech giant $1 billion in disbursements in 2014 to keep its search function as a default option on ioS devices. The worst performer on the Dow was  American Express  Company (N:AXP), which fell 7.58 or 12.10% to 55.06, after reporting weaker than expected earnings a session earlier.
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Incyte Corporation (O:INCY), which added 5.62 or 7.62% to 79.40. Incyte finished just head of SBAC, which jumped 6.53 or 7.46% to 94.02 after the South Florida-based wireless infrastructure manufacturer received an upgrade from analysts at Zack's Investment Research. The worst performer was Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), which fell 1.63 or 1.59% to 100.72, following reports that the streaming video company has begun blocking users VPN services, as it continues to expand globally into new emerging markets.
The top performer in the S&P 500 was Williams Companies Inc (N:WMB), which surged 3.70 or 23.07% to 19.74, helped by the bounce in oil prices. Shares in the Tulsa-based energy company are still down more than 62% over the last year. American Express (N:AXP) was also the worst performer on the S&P 500, just below Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc (N:FCX) which fell 0.39 or 9.01% to 3.94. Freeport-McMoran has been mired in a year-long slump prompted by the commodities rout in China.
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a 2,781-329 margin. The near 9:1 ratio contrasted starkly from trading conditions on Wednesday when the Dow fell more than 550 points at session-lows to fall near six-month lows. At that point, the ratio of declining to advancing stocks hovered near 30:1, a level previously not seen since the Financial Crisis.",-0.8658
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stocks--dow-downed-by-tech-on-china-worries-1746602,"Jan 14, 2019","Investing.com – Wall Street closed lower Monday as a drop in tech stocks on the back of worries about global growth. The fall was only partly offset by a rise in financials, which profited from  Citigroup  's solid fourth-quarter earnings report.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.36%, but closed well above its session lows of 23,765.24. The S&P 500 lost 0.59%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.94%.
Citigroup (NYSE:C) kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with a mixed report as earnings beat, while revenue missed consensus estimates, sending its shares 4% higher.
The mixed report from Citigroup did little to deter market participants, as investors viewed the recent sell off as ""perhaps being overdone given the overall quality in the Citigroup report,"" according to Briefing.com.
The surge in Citigroup sparked a wave of buys in other banking stocks as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) - both of which are slated to release quarterly earnings on Tuesday - ended the day higher.
Financials gained 1%, but gains in the broader market were stifled somewhat by falling tech stocks after weaker trade data from China raised concerns about slowing global growth.
Among FANG stocks, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) fell 1%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.5% as analysts called on the iPhone maker to cut prices of its latest smartphones in China and consider ""significant"" content acquisitions to drive services growth in 2019.
""Apple needs to aggressively cut prices in China on the iPhone XR as well as consider significant content acquisitions to drive services over the coming years,"" Wedbush said in a note to clients.
Apple was also pressured by fresh signs of waning iPhone demand after its supplier Dialog Semiconductor reported early revenue results at the low end of the expected range.
Energy names, meanwhile, struggled to advance after U.S. oil prices slipped 2.1% as concerns over slowing growth in China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, sparked fresh worries about a slowdown in demand.
In corporate news, Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE:PCG) slumped 52% after the utility said it will file for bankruptcy and its chief executive officer will step down.
The subdued start to the week for US stocks comes as analysts suggested there's more room for growth as the economy is better positioned than its global peers to weather storms either internally or beyond its borders.
""We believe this strategic overweight [to U.S. stocks] is still warranted. While the U.S. is not immune to developments beyond its borders, the country is better positioned to weather future storms than virtually any other. It is also sufficiently resilient to absorb uncertainty from within,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was off 7.5%, its biggest one-day loss since 2008, after revenue in its first-quarter report was $1 billion less than expected.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was off 1.9% ahead of a quarterly report expected to show a rare decline in earnings and revenue. The report was better than expected, however, and shares rose 5.5% after hours and could see its market cap top $1 trillion for the first time since November.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), up 0.65%, finished the day with a market cap of $1 trillion for the first time after topping the level twice last week. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s market cap briefly topped $1 trillion on Sept. 4.

The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.509% from 2.536% on Monday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.5%, but closed well above its session low of 24,768. The S&P 500 fell 0.55%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.42%.

The reversal in some tech blue chips from intraday lows comes ahead of a deluge of corporate earnings for the sector from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) due Wednesday, along with Alphabet, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) slated for Thursday.

In trade, meanwhile, Larry Kudlow, top White House economic advisor, told reporters that President Donald Trump will meet with China's president, Xi Jinping, next month at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, raising investor hopes that both leaders will seek to deescalate trade tensions.
On the corporate news front, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied more than 12% as Wall Street turned bullish on the automaker after the company unexpectedly announced it would release third-quarter results Wednesday, which CEO Elon Musk has said would show a profit for the period.
In an effort to streamline production at its assembly factor, Tesla said Tuesday it will eliminate some interior design options for the Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle.

The Internet company did not do enough to make clear that the $1,500 computer that mounts to a pair of eyeglasses was merely a prototype and not a finished product, Google's Astro Teller said during a talk at the South by Southwest Interactive conference in Austin.  ""We allowed and sometimes even encouraged too much attention for the program,"" said Teller, whose official title at Google is Captain of Moonshots, during a talk that focused on how his group has learned from some of its failures. Google stopped selling Glass to consumers earlier this year, noting that it was time for a ""pause"" and a strategy ""reset."" The company still sells Glass to businesses.  The device was greeted with enthusiasm among tech aficionados when it was first unveiled in 2012. But Glass, which allows users to access e-mail messages on its eye-level screen and to record video with a tiny camera, quickly ran into problems. Some mocked its awkward appearance, while others expressed concern it could be used to make video recordings surreptitiously. Teller said the ""bumps and scrapes"" the company experienced with Glass were ""absolutely critical for informing the future of Glass and wearables in general."" He also discussed the learning benefits of setbacks in other high-profile projects at the five-year-old Google X division, including drones, solar-powered balloons and self-driving cars.  Google initially designed its autonomous cars so that human drivers could take the controls when necessary but abruptly changed course when the company concluded that such a set-up was not safe enough, Teller said. Google's current self-driving car prototypes eliminate the steering wheel and brake pedal entirely, putting the machine always in control.  The decision to make such a change was not easy, he said, noting that the initial version of the company's self-driving modified Lexus SUVs had advanced to the point where the vehicles could handle highway driving extremely well. 
""We probably could have made a lot of money selling those,"" Teller said.",-0.7696

1. U.S. Futures Point to Flat Open 
U.S. stock futures pointed to a muted open, as market players looked ahead to the latest batch of quarterly earnings reports.
At 5:30AM ET (10:30 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures were up 20 points, or less than 0.1%, the S&P 500 futures tacked on 1 point, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 5 points.
Elsewhere, European stocks were mixed, with regional indices experiencing a choppy start to the trading week.
Earlier, markets in Asia closed mixed in subdued trade as many of the region's bourses were shut for the Lunar New Year. China's financial markets are closed all week, while those in South Korea are shut until Thursday.
2. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Kicks Off Busy Week of Earnings 
About 90 S&P 500 companies are due to report financial results this week, in what will be one of the last big waves of the fourth-quarter earnings season.
Monday sees Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) post results after the close. The tech giant is expected to report earnings per share of $10.88 on revenue of $38.91 billion, according to estimates.

3. U.S. Jobs Data Keeps Dollar Firm
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar pushed higher against its major rivals, as strong employment data pointed to underlying strength in the world's largest economy, underpinning demand for the greenback.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.2% at 95.48.
Meanwhile, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices slipped, pushing yields higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising to 2.70% and pulling further away from the four-week low of 2.619% it hit last week.
Monday's light economic calendar features factory orders figures for November due at 10:00AM ET (15:00 GMT).
4. Oil Prices Hit 2019 Highs 
In commodities, oil prices rose to their best levels of the year on signs that U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan exports have helped tighten supply.
Data showing that U.S. energy firms last week cut the number of oil rigs operating to their lowest in eight months and overall optimism over OPEC-led supply cuts also contributed to gains.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures climbed to a 2019 high of $55.74 a barrel, a level not seen since Nov. 21. It was last at $55.55, up 28 cents, or around 0.5%.
International Brent crude oil futures were at $63.39 per barrel, up 64 cents, or 1%. Brent earlier rose to its strongest level since Dec. 7 at $63.63.
5. May Continues to Search for Brexit Deal
British Prime Minister Theresa May has launched a new initiative in her fight to secure a Brexit deal with Brussels before the U.K. leaves the European Union in 53 days.
An ‘Alternative Arrangements Working Group’ will meet for the first time on Monday to discuss a new way forward on Brexit, according to a statement from May’s press team.
Chaired by Steve Barclay, the U.K.’s secretary of state for Brexit, the new AAWG will be attended by prominent pro-Brexit and pro-Europe Conservative lawmakers. Additional meetings will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, the statement said.
With less than two months until Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, concerns are growing over the risk of a disorderly 'no deal' exit.

Orders are accelerating for both the luxury crossover Model X and the 3-year-old Model S sedan, the company said on Tuesday. It estimated shipping 17,000 to 19,000 vehicles in the current quarter, up from 11,603 in the third quarter. ""We don't see any fundamental obstacle to achieving the production rate of several hundred (vehicles) per week sometime next month,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk said. Investors were relieved that orders of the X were not cutting into those of the S, said analyst Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer of Tigress Financial Partners. ""The X is selling well. It's not a cannibalizing car,"" he said. ""This year the stock still has a cult following, people who love the man and the cars and the company."" The stock rose to $227.40 in extended trading, after ending 2.5 percent lower at $208.35. As of the close, it was down 26 percent from a 12-month peak of $282.26 on July 20. Tesla said economies of scale, lower material costs and other factors would help them improve gross margin to over 30 percent on the S and X models within 18 months. But Tesla lowered the range of vehicles it expected to deliver this year, to 50,000-52,000, from the 50,000-55,000 it projected last quarter. Tesla started delivering the Model X Signature series, a premium version of the SUV, late in September. The Model 3, a mass-market vehicle expected to be priced at about $35,000, is due to be unveiled in March, but may take about two years to be in production, the company said. Tesla will tweak its trial autopilot feature in the wake of online videos showing drivers doing things like reading a newspaper while using the system. ""I do want to emphasize we discourage the crazy videos on YouTube,"" Musk told analysts on a conference call. ""We will be putting some additional constraints on when autopilot can be activated to minimize the possibility of people doing crazy things with that.""

Tesla said Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja, who announced his retirement earlier this year, will be replaced by former Google Inc (O:GOOG) executive Jason Wheeler. Capital expenditures will be lower in 2016 after this year's intense spending to develop the Model X and build Tesla's sprawling Gigafactory battery plant in Nevada, it said.     But in the fourth quarter, the company plans to invest about $500 million in the factory and other manufacturing activities, more than the $394 million in the third quarter.",-0.3849

The move pits Amazon against a slew of rivals including startup Square, which popularized a card swiper that plugs into a smartphone or tablet and allows small- and mid-sized businesses like food trucks and coffee shops to quickly accept credit and debit transactions.  The new point-of-sale system, called Amazon Local Register, would give Amazon crucial data on how U.S. consumers shop offline, analysts say. More than 90 percent of U.S. retail sales still take place in physical stores, according to U.S. government data.  On Wednesday, an Amazon spokeswoman said all data from Amazon Local Register customers would be securely protected and would not be used merely for fraud protection and risk management.  ""There may be some hesitation among merchants to process payments through Amazon due to data sharing or competitive concerns,"" R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote on Wednesday.  The biggest technology firms like Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Google Inc (O:GOOG) may also step up their investment in mobile payments, which is taking off as smartphones become ubiquitous.  Amazon hopes to court small businesses in part by charging lower fees than Square and eBay Inc's (O:EBAY) PayPal. Those who sign up for Amazon's program before October 31 will be charged 1.75 percent for each card swiped until January 2016.  For those who sign up after October, Amazon will take a 2.5 percent cut of each card swipe, still less than Square's 2.75 percent flat transaction rate and PayPal's 2.7 percent.  
Amazon's move ""was indicative of the blurring lines between commerce and payments, and ultimately Amazon competing against eBay/PayPal, Google and Apple in the mobile payment space,"" Sebastian said.   (Reporting by Deepa Seetharaman; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Andrew Hay)",0.9607
https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/twitter-sues-u.s.-justice-department-for-right-to-reveal-surveillance-requests-312149,"Oct 07, 2014","By Alexei Oreskovic SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (N:TWTR) sued the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday, intensifying its battle with federal agencies as the Internet industry's self-described champion of free speech seeks the right to reveal the extent of U.S. government surveillance.
The lawsuit, which Twitter said follows months of fruitless negotiations with the government, marks an escalation in the Internet industry's battle over government gag orders on the nature and number of requests for private user information.
In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for Northern California, Twitter said that current rules prevent it from even stating that it has not received any national security requests for user information.
The messaging service said such restrictions violate the Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of free speech.
""This is an important issue for anyone who believes in a strong First Amendment, and we hope to be able to share our complete transparency report,"" Twitter said in a blogpost.
Tech companies have sought to clarify their relationships with U.S. law enforcement and spying agencies in the wake of revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that outlined the depth of U.S. spying capabilities.
Twitter's lawsuit follows an agreement between Internet companies like Google Inc (O:GOOG) and Microsoft Corp (O:MSFT) with the government about court orders they receive related to surveillance.
The agreement freed the companies to disclose the number of orders they received, but only in broad ranges. A company that offers email services, for example, would be able to say it received between zero and 999 orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court during a six-month period for email content belonging to someone outside the United States.
In a separate case, a federal appeals court in San Francisco on Wednesday will hear arguments on whether the FBI can gag recipients of national security letters. A lower court judge had ruled those secrecy guidelines unconstitutional.
CAN'T EVEN DISCLOSE ZERO REQUESTS
Twitter, which allows its 271 million monthly users to send 140-character text messages, has traditionally taken an aggressive posture challenging government censorship requests and has previously described itself as ""the free-speech wing of the free-speech party.""
The American Civil Liberties Union praised Twitter's action, saying in a statement that the company was doing the right thing by ""challenging this tangled web of secrecy rules and gag orders.""
""The U.S. government has taken the position that service providers like Twitter are even prohibited from saying that they have received zero national security requests, or zero of a particular type of national security request,"" Twitter said in its complaint.
The Justice Department responded to the lawsuit with a statement on how it has worked with other companies.
""Earlier this year, the government addressed similar concerns raised in a lawsuit brought by several major tech companies,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. ""There, the parties worked collaboratively to allow tech companies to provide broad information on government requests while also protecting national security.""
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that defends civil liberties in the digital world, said it had been disappointed that tech companies had given up their fight.
""EFF and a number of privacy and free-speech organizations expressed our profound disappointment that the companies dropped their lawsuit for so little,"" Nate Cardozo, staff attorney with the group, said on Tuesday.
The government's restrictions on providing more details about requests for user data, he said, are ""useful for one thing, which is to keep the public in the dark about what authorities the government uses to get our data.
Twitter's lawsuit said the company has discussed the matter with the government for months. In a meeting with officials from the DOJ and the FBI in January, Twitter argued that it should not be bound by the disclosure limits that the government offered to Google and the other companies.
It said it submitted a draft transparency report with more detailed data to the FBI in April, but the agency denied Twitter's request to publish the draft five months later.

""We've tried to achieve the level of transparency our users deserve without litigation, but to no avail,"" Twitter said in Tuesday's blogpost. It said it was ""asking the court to declare these restrictions on our ability to speak about government surveillance as unconstitutional under the First Amendment.""

The Howard G. Buffet Foundation, the 60-year-old American's charity, is bankrolling construction to the tune of $19.7 million. It hopes the plant will help overcome chronic power shortages holding back development in the giant central African nation when it comes online in December. The 13.8 megawatt facility is just the first stage in an ambitious regional investment program drawn up by Congo's national parks authority (ICCN) and the Virunga Foundation, a British charity working in the giant Virunga national park in North Kivu. For the project's second stage, Buffett has already pledged a further $39 million towards the cost of two more hydroelectric plants. The Belgian government has provided $4 million more, but additional funds are still required.  The Virunga Foundation hopes to attract a total of $166 million to build seven hydro plants as well as hotels, vocational schools and other infrastructure in and around the national park over the next six years. ""Hydro plants are really the game changer,"" Buffett said in a telephone interview from Atlanta, Georgia. ""It provides jobs, it provides new resources, new investment. It helps keep people from cutting the trees down for charcoal in the forests. So it's like a win, win, win.""  Over the past two decades, Buffett's foundation has pumped more than $200 million into Africa's volatile Great Lakes region, which was plunged into turmoil by Rwanda's 1994 genocide. Resource-rich eastern Congo was ravaged by two regional wars between 1996 and 2003 that killed millions, most from hunger and disease. Despite vast deposits of minerals ranging from copper to diamonds and tantalum - a key component in mobile phones - Congo languishes next to the bottom of the U.N. development index. Two-thirds of its nearly 70 million people live in poverty, while its rugged east is plagued by dozens of armed groups, their ranks filled by young men with no prospect of jobs. A 20,000-man U.N. peacekeeping mission costing $1.4 billion a year - the world's largest – plus billions more spent on humanitarian aid have done little to improve conditions. Ongoing violence in and around Virunga - including a recent spate of kidnappings - present a deterrent to investors.  ""All the U.N. does is they bring a bunch of guys in, in uniform, and they park them (in) different strategic places, and when the going gets tough, they run,"" Buffett quipped.  The Nebraska native, who has spent millions on African projects from saving the South African rhino to hunting Lord's Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony, said he recognized that the investment was a gamble.   ""The government could take it away tomorrow. You could have a rebel group go in and blow it up tomorrow,"" he said. ""That's part of why we're doing it: because no-one else is interested in doing it.""  The Howard G. Buffett Foundation is a private, family charity that does not accept donations, with assets totaling more than $300 million, according to its last annual report. Much of its funding is believed to have come from his father's fortune, though Howard himself serves as a director of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and on several other corporate boards.    Buffett's investments have drawn mixed reviews from analysts who praise his commitment to the region and contributions to conservation and agricultural development but have criticized a heavy use of celebrity advocacy in expensive campaigns that they say do not engage with the complexity of the issues on the ground.  GOING PRIVATE Experts cite power shortages as one of the foremost barriers to development in Congo. Only about 10 percent of the population has access to electricity.         Emmanuel de Merode, CEO of the Virunga Foundation and director of the 7,800-square kilometer park, estimated that each additional megawatt would create around 1,000 local jobs. The estimate was based on a 0.2 MW pilot project that has attracted investment from Burundian firm Savonor in a 40-tonne per day soap factory that will use locally produced palm oil.   Google (O:GOOG) Chairman Eric Schmidt's charitable foundation made an initial investment to facilitate the project.       De Merode, a Belgian who starred in last year's Oscar-nominated, Buffett-produced documentary about the threat of oil exploration in Virunga, said that the initiative responded to an urgent need for large-scale employment opportunities that only the private sector could create. But some local residents see the initiative as yet another foreign imposition whose priorities do not match their own.  Chrispin Mvano, an independent researcher and journalist in North Kivu, criticized park authorities for failing to collaborate with local communities, who wonder whether they will benefit from the new electricity. ""We'd say that Emmanuel de Merode has become the president of ... the National Republic of Virunga,"" said Mvano. He called for greater support to agriculture, the dominant economic activity in the area, and existing small-scale hydroelectric projects. Virunga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to home to roughly half the world's remaining 900 mountain gorillas, is a cause celebre among conservationists.  But the protected status of the park, created in 1925 by the Belgian colonial government, is resented by many of the more than four million people who live near it but are prevented from cultivating its rich soil.   In a letter to de Merode last month, activists from the southern edge of the park complained that park rangers routinely violate the boundaries and have seized their land.     ""Before being a world patrimony, (Virunga) is a local patrimony,"" Mvano said.  De Merode acknowledged ""enormous tensions"" with local populations in enforcing park limits but said that industrialization was the only long-term solution for the region.      
Even those who agree, say the project remains a long shot to bring development to one of the world's most unsettled regions. Innocent Gasigwa, a spokesman for civil society in the territory of Rutshuru, said he supported the hydroelectric projects but warned: ""If just one war breaks out again, it's over.""",0.9901
"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-pay-to-launch-on-monday,-more-banks-signed-on-313270","Oct 16, 2014","By Christina Farr  CUPERTINO Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) faster, slimmer iPads come with modest improvements, such as a fingerprint sensor, but some analysts say it offers few other features to wow consumers ahead of a holiday shopping season expected to be swamped by mobile devices.  At a launch event on Thursday, Chief Executive Tim Cook called Apple's new line-up, which includes a new iMac computer with a ""5K retina"" or high-end display, the company's best ever. But analysts say Apple may struggle to arouse the same passion for its tablets as in past years among consumers faced with an abundance of hand-held, touch-screen devices.  ""I've got to be honest and say, the only impressive thing was the 5K retina display on the iMac,"" said Gartner analyst Van Baker, who attended the show at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. ""The other things we saw (included) just iterative improvements on the iPad.""  Marketing chief Phil Schiller called the larger tablet the world's slimmest and described several new features such as an anti-reflective screen. He also confirmed the inclusion of the ""Touch ID"" sensor, already available on the latest iPhones.  Pre-orders start Friday for the larger iPad Air 2, priced at $499 and up, with shipping beginning next week. The smaller iPad mini 3 will be about $100 cheaper.  The new iMac, which sports the new ""Yosemite"" operating system, will go for $2,499.  Tablet sales are set to rise only 11 percent this year, according to tech research firm Gartner, compared to 55 percent last year, even as smartphone sales continue to soar and personal computer sales are waning.  DEFINING MOMENT  Tablet sales for Apple, which defined the category with the iPad just four years ago, have fallen for two straight quarters. Investors remain focused on the iPhone, Apple's main revenue generator, but a prolonged downturn in iPad sales would threaten about 15 percent of the company's revenue.  The new iPads will go up against recently introduced tablets from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Google Inc (O:GOOG) in coming months. Shares of Apple slid 1 percent to $96.57 shortly before the close.  Apple also said it will launch its new electronic payments service on Monday, after the iPhone maker signed up another 500 banks to support a feature that competes with eBay Inc's (O:EBAY) PayPal and other online systems.  Cook said developers were beginning to design apps for its upcoming Watch.  Apple last month introduced the Watch, its first new device since the iPad in 2010. The company's entry into the rapidly expanding wearable computing arena will be available only from 2015, but Cook said software development kits for the device will be available from November.  Missing on Thursday was a larger, 12-inch-plus iPad, the subject of industry speculation ahead of Apple's event.  ""It is disappointing, particularly to enterprise buyers, that there wasn't a 12.9 inch iPad model,"" said Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder. ""To return iPad to high growth, form factor innovation will be required. We'll have to wait until 2015 to see if Apple addresses this issue.""

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/google-rates-internet-service-providers'-video-streaming-quality-293348,"Jul 07, 2014","By Marina LopesWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google Inc (O:GOOG) is rating Internet service providers' video streaming quality on a new website, the latest development in the fight between broadband providers and content companies over who is to blame for slow streaming speeds.
A link to the website appears when videos on Google's streaming service, YouTube, are slow to buffer. The website quietly launched in May, but recently drew growing publicity.
""There are many factors that influence your video streaming quality, including your choice of Internet Service Provider (ISP). Learn how your ISP performs and understand your options,"" the website reads.
Google rates the Internet service providers based on how quickly billions of hours of YouTube videos watched every month load over 30 days and divides those results by provider and location to determine the quality of performance viewers get 90 percent of the time, the company said.
The website is intended to inform customers who want to view video in high-definition how best to do it, Matt McLernon, a YouTube spokesman said.
""We are just basically providing information, not trying to tell people to change their behavior or do anything different,"" said McLernon.
Customers can compare the performance of various Internet service providers in their area through the website.
Google is not the first content company to send messages directly to consumers about their Internet service providers. In June, Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) sent its customers messages that Verizon Inc (N:VZ) and other Internet providers were to blame for slow speeds.
Last month, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission announced it would investigate agreements between Internet service providers and content companies to determine whether they are causing slow speeds.

Netflix has been calling on the FCC to do away with fees content companies pay to Internet service providers for smooth delivery of their services to consumers.
The FCC is expected to consider that idea as it seeks public comment on recently proposed Internet traffic, or ""net neutrality,"" rules that suggest content companies should be allowed to strike ""commercially reasonable"" deals with broadband providers to give priority to their traffic.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/why-china-keeps-tangling-with-apple-294443,"Jul 11, 2014","By Matt Schiavenza - Since first appearing on the Chinese market in 2007, iPhones have endured a series of challenges, but the iconic smart phones made by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had never been accused of threatening the country’s security. But on Friday the country’s state-run broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) said that the iPhone's “Frequent Locations” tracker possesses “extremely sensitive data” that, if revealed, may disclose national secrets.
The Mountain View, California, has not yet responded to the CCTV statement. John Brownlee, a blogger at the Cult of Mac, characterized the allegations as “absurd” and noted that Apple does not keep any information stored in the “Secret Locations” tab.
The report is merely the latest clash between a major American tech company and the Chinese government. In May, Beijing issued an edict forbidding government-operated computers from running Windows 8, the newest operating system of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), citing a security concern with the widely used Windows XP. The Chinese government has also interfered with Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) services, disrupting email and search services throughout the country, and has clashed with hardware companies like Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC).

National security concerns have increasingly dominated the Sino-American relationship. Since 2013, when the New York Times revealed that a Chinese army unit spied on American interests from an unmarked building near Shanghai, each country has accused the other of widespread espionage. Beijing has accused Apple of providing sensitive data to the U.S. government, a charge Apple has denied.
But Beijing’s criticism of Apple may have a separate commercial motive. In the past two years, Xiaomi, an inexpensive smart phone created and manufactured in China, has emerged as a strong domestic competitor to the iPhone. Beijing has identified technological innovation as a national economic priority.

But there were struggles among big tech stocks as well as the defensive stocks that have led the market in recent weeks.
And the market pretty much stalled.
The S&P 500 was off slightly because of the tech weakness, which was more visible in the declines seen in the Nasdaq Composite, down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq 100 index, down 0.26%. The Dow, however, moved up 0.14% because of gains in its financial components, especially Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
The gains in financials reflected higher interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield moved up to 1.646% from Friday's 1.55%.
Falls in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO),   Intuit   (NASDAQ:INTU) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) were among the bigger decliners among tech stocks.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were higher. And the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index climbed 0.8%, helped by Intel, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO).
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA),   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT), and chemical maker Dow led the Dow, along with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).
Energy stocks were buoyed by higher oil prices. West Texas Intermediate crude was up $1.33 to $57.85 a barrel. Brent oil futures crude rose $1.05 to $62.59.
The gains were prompted by Saudi Arabia's naming Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as the new oil minister. He's expected to push for continuing production cuts among members of OPEC. Saudi Arabia has been trying to push global crude prices to $70 a barrel or higher to take of internal economic needs. 
Also pressuring oil prices -- and boosting energy stocks -- was Israeli Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that Iran has a secret nuclear weapons site. The claim raised Middle Eastern tensions.
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Apache (NYSE:APA) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) were among the bigger gainers.   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) added nearly 1%.   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) was up 0.8%.

The gains were due to strong earnings Thursday for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), up 10%, and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), up 8.9% and the federal government's approval of T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) $26-billion deal to merge with Sprint (NYSE:S). T-Mobile climbed 5.6%. Sprint rose 7.4%.
The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,026 with a 0.7% gain. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indices jumped more than 1% each. All three indices reached new intraday highs as well.
The Dow was up a more modest 0.2%, led by Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), up 2.1%, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), up 1.74%, and health-insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), up 1.7%. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also hit a new intraday high of $141.71 and closed up 0.8% at a record $141.34.
The blue-chip index continued to be held back by continuing weakness in shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA), which is struggling to get its 737 Max jetliner back into service. The plane has been grounded since March after fatal crashes of the plane in Ethiopia and Indonesia, and it's possible the plane would go back into service until January.
Boeing was off 0.9% and subtracted 21 points from the Dow on Friday. It was off 8.6% on the week.
The market mostly embraced a Commerce Department report that U.S. gross domestic product grew 2.1% in the second quarter, compared with a 1.8% estimate.
But earnings reports this week proved to have much more influence.
The S&P 500 was up 1.7% for the week, with the Nasdaq up 2.23%. The Dow added 0.14%. For the year, the S&P 500 is up 20.7%, with the Nasdaq up 25.5% and the Dow up 16.6%.
And investors seem to believe that economic growth will push higher if, as expected, the Federal Reserve cuts its key interest rate next week. The Fed decision is due Wednesday afternoon. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool says there's a 100% chance the Fed's key rate, the federal funds rate, will drop to 2% to 2.25%, down from 2.25% to 2.5% now. 
The Trump administration has been pushing for lower rates to push the value of the dollar lower against major currencies. There was some talk this week the Administration might sell dollars to push the greenback lower. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, is up 25% since the end of 2009.
Next week has two big news-making events.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) weighs in with fiscal-third-quarter results after Tuesday's close. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the iPhone maker to report $2.09 a share in earnings down from $2.16 a year ago, with revenue of $53.35 billion, up slightly from a year ago. Apple shares are up 33% this year after falling 6.7% in 2018 and 30% in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Friday brings the July jobs report. 
Oil prices moved up slightly with  West Texas intermediate crude rising 18 cents to $56.20 a barrel. Brent oil futures added 7 cents to $63.46.
Interest rates were flat to lower, with the 10-Year yield falling to 2.072% from Thursday's 2.083%.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/google-calls-for-uk-antitrust-action-against-microsoft-in-cloud-computing-3248038,"Dec 01, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG) has recently urged the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud computing practices, alleging anti-competitive behavior that stifles the market. This request emerges amid broader scrutiny of the cloud computing industry dominated by Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in various global regions, including the UK, European Union, and the United States. Google's push for regulatory intervention was detailed in a letter to the CMA, which Reuters obtained.
The letter highlights Google's concerns about Microsoft's licensing practices, which they claim unfairly limit competition and customer choice in the UK's cloud computing sector. According to Google, Microsoft's practices effectively compel customers to rely on Azure, Microsoft's cloud service, even if they prefer the offerings of competitors like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud. This situation, Google argues, directly harms customers and represents a significant obstacle to market competition. In response to these allegations, the CMA has remained silent, choosing not to comment publicly.
While Microsoft has attempted to address these concerns by updating its licensing rules to promote competition, rivals, including Google, have found these changes insufficient. A Microsoft spokesperson defended the company's efforts, noting that over 100 independent cloud providers have embraced their revised policies and that competition in the cloud hyperscaler market remains robust. Despite these claims, Google Cloud Vice President Amit Zavery criticizes Microsoft's approach, advocating for a multi-cloud strategy that allows customers greater freedom to move between different cloud services according to their needs.
The core of the dispute centers around Microsoft's policy updates related to using their software licenses, like Windows, in the cloud. These updates have seemingly made it more expensive for customers to use Google (GOOGL) or AWS instead of Azure. Google argues that while AWS, the market leader, doesn't impose similar constraints, Microsoft's licensing restrictions prevent fair competition. Google's recommendations to the CMA include enforcing Microsoft to enhance interoperability for customers using Azure alongside other services and prohibiting Microsoft from withholding security updates from clients switching to other providers.

But the Teen Choice ads did see paid premiums, with some paying $75,000 for the six seconds, Advertising Age reports. The minimal ad length is an import from the digital world, where YouTube (GOOG +0.9%, GOOGL +1%) has been using it for a year, and Facebook (FB +0.7%) is developing its own six-second spots as it leans on its new ""Watch"" video programming tab.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV comes in at the back of the pack with 21.3m.  Paul Verna, eMarketer’s principal video analyst, cites Roku’s neutrality as its primary tailwind. The company doesn’t have any ties to specific content or TV device platforms and can form content partnerships more easily. A fight between Amazon and Apple kept the former’s app off the latter’s TV until this year, which might have hurt Apple’s share of the streaming market.  Google and Amazon also have the advantage of integrated their voice assistants into the streaming device, which could drive up the user base as smart home solutions become more popular.

The company's shift towards a consumption-based pricing model and the introduction of a freemium model have been instrumental in driving user growth and adoption of premium features. Domo also announced plans to refinance and extend the maturity of its outstanding debt.
Key takeaways from the call:Domo achieved its highest operating income of $5 million and an operating margin of 6%.Over 20% of Domo's Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is now on the consumption model, with plans to shift the majority of revenue to this model by the end of next year.The company has launched a freemium model, which has resulted in customers signing up for paid deals within a short sales cycle.Domo has made architectural changes to allow customers to keep data and associated querying and processing with partners like Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), AWS, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).The company reported Q3 billings of $74.8 million, a 1% YoY increase, and total revenue of $79.7 million, also a 1% YoY increase. Subscription revenue accounted for 89% of total revenue and grew 3% YoY.Domo expects a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.05 to $0.09 for Q4, and $0.24 to $0.28 for the full year.The company is in the process of refinancing its debt to reduce interest rates and extend maturity.Domo's consumption model, which allows customers to pay based on usage rather than a fixed seat-based model, has seen success, winning new customers and upselling existing ones. The company reported examples of a Canadian retailer that switched to Domo to consolidate data, a healthcare software company that tripled its contract size after adopting Domo's consumption model, and an educational software company that chose Domo for its ETL needs and embedded analytics.
The company's freemium model, Domo Everywhere, provides data to partners' customers and turns data provision into a profit center. The company is confident that this model will continue to drive adoption and revenue growth.
Domo also reported cost optimization measures, including a reduction of its workforce by about 7%. The company aims to achieve positive operating cash flow for FY '24 and free cash flow positive for FY '25. Domo (NASDAQ: DOMO) has engaged an investment bank to help with refinancing and extending the maturity of its outstanding debt, with significant interest from potential lenders.
The company resolved several at-risk enterprise accounts and expects a recovery in the next three to four quarters. Domo believes it is making the right moves for long-term growth and feels better positioned with its customers. The shift to consumption has been positive, allowing the company to upsell and save accounts. The architectural change allows Domo to keep computing charges and credits when partnering with other companies.InvestingPro InsightsDomo, Inc.'s latest earnings report has demonstrated a strategic pivot that's garnering attention, with their shift to a consumption-based pricing model and the launch of a freemium service. In light of these developments, let's delve into some key metrics and tips from InvestingPro that could provide a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.
InvestingPro Data shows Domo's market capitalization stands at $342.43M, reflecting the market's current valuation of the company. Despite an impressive gross profit margin of 76.47% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, the company's P/E ratio is -4.39, indicating that investors are expecting negative earnings. This aligns with the company's current trajectory, as it is not anticipated to be profitable this year. Additionally, the revenue growth has been reported at 11.47% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, which, while positive, shows a deceleration when compared to previous periods.
An InvestingPro Tip that stands out is the concern over Domo's ability to meet short-term obligations, as its liquid assets fall short of its immediate liabilities. This could be a crucial factor for investors to consider, especially in the context of the company's plans to refinance its debt. Moreover, with two analysts revising their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, there is a notable caution in the market sentiment surrounding Domo's future performance.
For readers interested in a more comprehensive analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, which can shed light on aspects such as stock price volatility, the increase in total debt over consecutive years, and a strong return over the last month. Domo's strategic moves and the market's response highlight the importance of staying informed with real-time data and expert insights.

Other than revenue, unless otherwise stated, we will be discussing our results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from our GAAP results. Please refer to the tables in our earnings press release for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure, which we have posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at domoinvestors.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Josh. Josh?
Josh James: Thank you, Pete, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. In Q3, we were able to exceed guidance for our key top-line metrics, including revenue, subscription revenue, and billings. A highlight in the quarter is that we had our highest operating income in history of $5 million, and our highest operating margin in history of 6%. Over the past few years, and especially the last few quarters, we have been incubating critical pivots that are finally coming together. They are clear and powerful priorities that are removing friction and strengthening our ability to deliver unmatched value to the market. Specifically, several years ago, we decided to test an idea: ""What would customers do if they had unlimited access to features for an unlimited number of users and all visualization for free?"" It was a simple value prop to customers. Pay for the value you are realizing. Well, after positive feedback we decided to run an even broader pilot last year, and the pilot proved to be a smash hit. We now feel like we've reached critical mass with over 20% of our ARR on the consumption model. As we continue to look at the results from this very large sample size, we feel very confident in making the decision and saying we're going all in on consumption. By the end of next year, we expect to have the vast majority of our revenue on the consumption model. Again, we now have over 400 customers on consumption contracts, representing over 15% of our customer base and over 20% of our ARR. When customers move to consumption, we are seeing user counts growing at almost 3 times the speed of seat-based customers. And we are seeing 3 times the adoption rate on premium features like data science. We've also rolled out reporting so our customers can see in real time what their consumption patterns are. So far, even with the highest usage our customers are seeing, the feedback has been incredibly positive because customers recognize the value of that usage. As an example, it took us eight years at a fast food chain to get an ARR of about $200,000. Now that they've converted to consumption, this company has committed to an ARR of over $550,000 over the next three years by expanding the use of Domo across the organization. One fun story to relate that has happened to me on multiple occasions over the last few months is watching how our customers react to the new model. I've seen the epiphanies go off in their eyes as they recognize and then look at people internally in the room and tell them conclusively that because they now have unlimited users, they can start looking at sunsetting all of their other BI technologies and legacy reporting tools and use Domo instead. Well, I couldn't have said it better myself. In support of our consumption strategy and to pave a completely open path to adoption, we've also launched a new freemium model. Freemium was impossible before our consumption model and gives everyone a risk-free opportunity to get in and try Domo with no obligations and no restrictions. Domo customers have access to all the Domo features with unlimited users and they can tackle any use case they want. And when they want to go bigger, they can click from within Domo to buy consumption credits and have an unlimited highway to multiply their impact on their business. This approach seamlessly aligns with our core philosophy of delivering value before requiring payment, reinforcing our commitment to providing accessible and valuable solutions to our users. We rolled out our free offering last month and will be rapidly iterating on it over the next quarter to focus on user experience and easy onboarding. We think that long term, this alters our ability to attract new customers and give them a friction-free path to move through the pipeline from free to paid usage to sharing with more users to broad use case adoption. Of course, this naturally leads to expanding credits and being ready for a long-term relationship with our sales and support organization. This new flow evolves us from having to work with cold leads to being able to talk with happy customers who already see the value of the platform and are ready to lean in more. To demonstrate the power of having a freemium model, let me share a story from two weeks ago. Our sales team had been calling a CTO prospect for over a year with no luck. One of our salespeople called the CTO on a Friday afternoon and left a message about freemium and the free credits it comes with. The CTO proceeded to sign up for a free instance, and over the weekend, multiple users connected to disparate data sources and built data flows powering over 40 reports. By Monday, the CTO was in love with the product and signed up for a three-year deal with a total contract value well into the six figures. And that was a three-day sales cycle. Our freemium product also completely changes the conversation with potential partners who have wanted to leverage our Domo Everywhere product to deliver data experiences through Domo for their own customers. In the past, if we had a customer with, say, 20,000 external end users, it would have required a major upfront investment, which often led our customer to reduce the use case to maybe just the top 5% of external customers. With freemium, however, we can give all 20,000 of those users a free instance of Domo immediately at no cost. This creates a very meaningful introduction to Domo for those end users with an obvious upgrade experience because they can experience the value and immediately expand and put more of their own data in our platform. In a consumption world, focusing on adoption through product-led growth and support programs is the critical path to success for both customers and for Domo. Increased adoption leads to happier and more successful customers, and the corollary is, of course, increased revenue. As we roll out features and training that support adoption, we've seen our customers rapidly expand their usage of our platform compared to when they were under seat-based pricing. For example, one of our largest customers had been a customer for six years. In those first six years, they had grown to 3,500 active users and 17 departments. Then, they converted to our consumption model. The growth was rapid. In just one additional year, they added 2,300 more active users and more than doubled the number of departments and use cases. This has dramatically increased the return for the customer and, of course, has strengthened our relationship in the account. In support of our shift to the consumption model, focusing on our customers' adoption of our platform brings complete alignment between us and our customers around multiplying value. It's all about opening up unlimited use cases to address a completely expanding list of customer needs. And it helps us learn more about what drives customer success. For example, which product features and functionality in our products really drive expanded usage? What of our support behaviors drive additional adoption of our products? It shifts the dynamic from trying to sell the customer more products to helping them find more ways to receive value. Now, the progress we've made with our consumption model and with our launch of freemium has dramatically altered our ability to be successful within the ecosystem and our partners. Only recently, we've changed our architecture to allow Domo to drive consumption for partners like Snowflake, AWS, and Microsoft. Before now, we've had conflict in the channel, where we sometimes drove consumption or compute away from our vendors. With the architecture changes, we now allow customers to choose to keep the data and the associated querying and processing of data with our partners. It was a substantial investment on our part, but we are very excited that this has all been reconciled. Because of these changes, we'll be making some announcements soon, describing partnerships where customers are able to retire spend by purchasing Domo through various app stores and marketplaces from major tech players. As it relates to AI, this is another area where consumption allows our customers to get in and start seeing the value of AI in their business without an upfront commitment or investment. As mentioned earlier, we've seen dramatically higher uptake in our data science offerings among our consumption customers compared to our seat-based customers, and we expect to see similar levels of adoption as we continue to expand our AI service layer and other AI offerings. The consumption model will expose many more customers to AI because they don't have to sign a contract before they start using it. This in turn, of course, drives consumption. We have several AI-related product launches lined up for the coming months that will help our customers build reports and interact with their data in a ChatGPT-like fashion. Now, to illustrate the impact of this new model that has already penetrated over 20% of our ARR, please let me share some real-life examples from some of our customers. So first, a significant new logo win with a Canadian retailer that was using competing BI solutions was having issues with silo data and with connecting to data in disparate systems. The company chose Domo for our consumption model, which made it easy for them to sunset legacy seat-based tools when they weren't sure they were getting the value that they needed. We are starting to see more and more of these cases, and it's certainly good to be the consolidator. A healthcare software company was using our Domo Everywhere solution to provide data to their medical customers. The company was adding new Domo Everywhere customers at a faster rate than expected and it was challenging under a seat-based model where they had to commit to their investment before receiving the value. Since transferring over to consumption now, our customer has tripled their contract size with us, and yes, that math works. An educational software company was debating which vendor to use for their ETL needs. They entered into an upsell contract with Domo, not only because of our ETL features, but because our consumption contract structure allowed them to predict their cost with a high level of confidence. Additionally, the company had been considering using Domo Everywhere to provide embedded analytics to thousands of their end users. Moving to a consumption model, opened the door for them to test out our Domo Everywhere experience in a very cost-effective manner. And then, because of the value they've seen in the Domo platform, this customer has committed to dramatically alter the scale of their investment and agreed to a two-year six-figure ARR contract in Q3 with a significant upsell built into the second year. Is consumption driving adoption? It certainly looks like it. Another example is a financial services company that purchased Domo to consolidate data from multiple loan origination systems. The consumption model was key to their decision to go with Domo because it unlocked our data science and sandbox features, which were critical to their use case and would have been outside their budget under our seat-based model. Does access to all of Domo help customers unlock the value of the entire platform and become more committed to the entirety of our platform? I think so. A digital customer engagement platform company has been a Domo customer for a decade. The initial use case was for sales and marketing analytics. However, about a year ago, the company was considering a cancellation because they felt like they were paying too much per seat for about 350 users. What saved the account was a move to consumption with unlimited users. Using our product, they created an app, and because they have unlimited users, they were able to deploy the app company-wide, and now have over a thousand users on Domo's platform. Not only did we save an account that was going to cancel, several months after they converted to consumption, they actually committed to an increased level of consumption and upped their spend with us. Now, would we have been able to save this customer without consumption? No. And now we have an upsell. Looking outside of Q3, here's a few more examples of how consumption is changing the game for us. A healthcare analytics company, which is using several of our larger competitors, is looking to replace some business objects and other legacy providers. Consumption is allowing the company to replace the other vendors and expand Domo without the friction of a new contract discussion. Can Domo benefit from vendor consolidation? Yes, we can. Another small highlight is a digital asset company that was about to cancel because they thought we were too expensive for the number of users they had in the account on seat-based pricing. They moved to a consumption contract with unlimited users. Additionally, they agreed to triple their contract size, and then, just last week, agreed to triple it again. So, they are now close to 10x their original size, as opposed to just recently being on the brink of canceling. Do I wish that all my customers were on consumption contracts? Yes, I do. Lastly, an insurance company that was paying us $200,000 a year moved to consumption because our seat-based model didn't allow them to expand as rapidly as they wanted to. With the initial move to consumption, they increased their contract with us by over $100,000. 15 months later, after they had been able to fully realize the value Domo can provide due to having unlimited users and functionality, they added another $200,000 annually to their contract to replace their spend with Cognos. So, in totality, I think these are some great examples of multiple customers that highlight the progress we are making as a company. Now, while we are marching toward improving the prospects of the company, we are also optimizing our costs so we can operate as efficiently as possible. To that end, we've made changes that impacts approximately 7% of our workforce, as well as reductions in contractors, marketing programs, and other expenses. We are cognizant of the effect this has on people and would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to everyone for their contributions. Now, as we look to the future, I'm sure you can feel my energy around these pivots we're making and the signals we're seeing from customers and partners that resoundingly convince us that they're the right moves. Even when we were growing 30% quarter-over-quarter -- year-over-year, I wasn't this optimistic about our future and our stability as I am now. We're quickly migrating to the consumption model. In Q4, we'll have the vast majority of our new logo customers on consumption and we will continue to encourage our existing customers to switch to consumption, resulting in the vast majority of our ARR transition to the consumption model within the next year. Freemium, our adoption programs, and our AI investments will continue to bolster our efforts in moving to consumption where customers are able to experience value and see the vision of what Domo can mean to their company before having to pay and commit to everything. All of these changes will also lead to a dramatic shift in our approach and success with partners and the broader ecosystem over the next 12 months, which should meaningfully impact our ability to generate leads efficiently. Domo is becoming a much more interesting company with prospects that excite our broader team. And with that, I'll now turn it over to David.
David Jolley: Thanks, Josh. I love those examples. Like you, I'm excited about our key areas of focus and believe we're really well positioned to execute on the opportunities in front of us. Now, while we aspire to higher growth rates than we're currently experiencing, I'm pleased that we were able to exceed the billings guidance that we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We delivered Q3 billings of $74.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 1%. Total revenue was $79.7 million, also a year-over-year increase of 1%. Subscription revenue represented 89% of our total revenue and grew... [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: One moment, everyone, while we reconnect the speaker line. Please stand by, and do not disconnect. Once again, everyone, please stand by. Once again, everyone, we are reconnecting the speaker line. Please stand by.
David Jolley: All right, are we back live again?
Operator: You are live. Please go ahead.
David Jolley: All right, very good. Sorry for the short delay. But thanks, Josh. I appreciate that and appreciate those great examples. Like you, I'm excited about our key areas of focus and believe we're well positioned to execute on the opportunities in front of us. Now, while we aspire to higher growth rates than we're currently experiencing, I'm pleased that we were able to exceed the billings guidance that we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We delivered Q3 billings of $74.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 1%. Total revenue was $79.7 million, also a year-over-year increase of 1%. Subscription revenue represented 89% of our total revenue and grew 3% year-over-year. And our ARR grew roughly in-line with subscription revenue growth. In reviewing the metrics that will impact the remainder of the year, our current RPO was $230.8 million, consistent with last year. And our total RPO grew 4% to $367.2 million as of October 31. On a dollar-weighted measure, we continue to have approximately two-thirds of our customers in our multi-year contracts. Our gross retention was above 85%, and net retention was about 95%. Last quarter, we identified potential renewal challenges with several large customers. And while we and some of our customers continue to face challenging IT spending environment, in Q3, these renewals discussions played out somewhat better than expected, which did help our results. In regards to the large renewal risks that we had identified last quarter, we have saved a few of them and have not identified any beyond those that we had identified in last quarter for the fourth quarter. Moving on to margins and profitability. Our subscription gross margin was 84.8%, up 0.2 percentage points from Q3 of last year. And non-GAAP operating margin was a record high 6.3%, up 5.4 percentage points from a year ago. Our net loss was very close to breakeven at $24,000, which is our best result to date, and a big improvement from a net loss of $4.4 million a year ago. Net loss per share was $0, based on 36.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. In Q3, cash used in operations was approximately $4.3 million. We capitalized approximately $2 million of software costs, resulting in a decline of our cash balance of $6.5 million from last quarter to $57.4 million. Cash flow from operations in Q3 was negatively impacted by the timing of collections on some receivables. However, we're still on track to generate positive operating cash flow for FY '24, and therefore, expect our Q4 cash flow from operations to be in the range of $3 million to $4 million. Looking forward to next year, we're committed to not only being operating cash flow positive, but we are targeting free cash flow positive for FY '25. In order to bring our cost structure in alignment with this target, we recently reduced our headcount-related expense by approximately 7% and also optimize a handful of other costs. For Q4 top-line metrics, we're guiding to a billing range of $102 million to $103 million, and expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $79 million to $80 million. For the full year of fiscal '24, we expect billings to be in the range of $317.7 million to $318.7 million, and we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $317.8 million to $318.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 3%. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, of $0.05 to $0.09 for Q4. This assumes a 36.8 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, of $0.24 to $0.28. This assumes 36.1 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. Additionally of note is the fact that we've engaged an investment bank to assist us with refinancing and extending the maturity of our outstanding debt. And at this point in the process, we have a significant level of interest from potential lenders. In conclusion, we posted better-than-expected top-line results with record profitability and believe we're making the right moves to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Eric Martinuzzi: Yeah, congrats on the good numbers for the quarter, and I appreciate the examples regarding the capacity-based pricing impacts. I wanted to understand a little bit more on the risk of non-renewals. I think last quarter, you talked about four or five enterprise accounts that were in danger and that was part of the reset to the outlook for FY '24. Can you give us a little better color? Have we reached resolution on those four or five at-risk enterprise accounts?
Josh James: Yes, we've reached resolution. Good news, we were actually able to keep a couple of them just with down sales, but we still kept them as customers. So that was a little bit of a bright spot when it came to the bad news. And this quarter, we've -- given the guidance, we're obviously not -- we're not on a toward pace here, but we, at the same time, feel pretty good about looking out over the next three, four quarters in terms of the pacing of where customers are that are at risk. It feels like we hit the bottom of that, and we're recovering from that. And like we mentioned, many of the examples with the consumption pricing, we actually end up on the consolidation, being the consolidator side of the equation versus having just being impacted by others. So, the move to consumption definitely changed the relationship with a lot of our customers and has helped us save a bunch of accounts. And we think especially as that plays out over the future, like we talked about, there's so many upsells that we're getting from these accounts. If you look at the cohort of customers that have been through renewal, we haven't lost any customers that have signed up to consumption. And it's a smaller sample size, 30 to 40, but as that number gets bigger, we'll keep watching that. But it certainly is extremely encouraging looking at the 20% of our business that's purely consumption and knowing that we can get that number to a vast majority just over the next 12 months.
Eric Martinuzzi: Okay. The other comment that you made last quarter was regarding the pipeline. And you characterized the pipeline back then as soft in all stages. I'm wondering if you could update that view on the pipeline.
Josh James: Yeah, it feels -- as we look at the numbers, it seems like we've started to turn. There's seven, eight, nine numbers that all feel like they've barely started to turn, but it's barely. But all of our checks, it looks like things are -- hit the bottom last quarter and just are starting to slightly improve. So hopefully that's how things play out. But we're feeling like we have our arms wrapped around the situation much better and we feel like we're in a much better position in terms of the relationship that we have with our customers and our ability to sell consumption, our ability to get our customers over to consumption, training up the reps, training up the client services folks, focusing on adoption and helping people find these additional use cases. So, we feel like we're much better positioned and feel like we've got much better visibility into the customers and the contracts at this stage.
Eric Martinuzzi: Understand. Good luck in Q4.
Josh James: Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Oliver Crookenden with JMP Securities.
Pat Walravens: Actually, it's Pat, but -- Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Thank you. So, Josh, I do love the shift to consumption, and we've seen a lot of other people do it, but I was wondering if you could balance it out a little bit. I mean, there are some negatives to the consumption model, too, right? So, what do you give up when you make this shift?
Josh James: Yeah, we -- I think if you went around the room and e-staff and tried to figure out what the negatives are, I don't -- we're not seeing any negatives. The one difference in the model is you're not going to sign up any seven-figure new logo deals, right? When you go start to use AWS, you don't walk in and be like, ""Hey, give me a couple of million bucks worth."" You try it out and you start spending it and if you like it, you decide that you want to commit to get lower rates, and we're seeing that same thing. So, brand new seven-figure buildings walking in the door, we're not going to have as many of those. They'll happen, but they'll happen as those customers grow. So, we're seeing those relationships. We have some really big customers that are signing up right now that on the old seat model, we'd be signing up for $3 million, $4 million, but -- annually. But in the consumption model, you sign them up for $400,000 and then another $500,000, and then you get to a couple of million bucks. And you still get to the same spot. You get there more efficiently, more effectively. There's not as many -- not as much hemming and hawing. You're not going through as many use cases and approvals internally, but at the same time, you also don't have the big billings hits until they've had time to bake. So, we'll have to wait for some of those things to bake a little bit.
Pat Walravens: Okay, great.
David Jolley: I think, Pat, another -- just another comment was that I think early on there was a concern, well, geez, if we're giving them whole platform, is there going to be anything to sell them later on? And there was some concern about that. But the way that's working is when we provide the whole platform and open up all the seats, it's then just about helping the customer identify how to solve more of their data issues and more use cases. And as they do that, that's the upsell. It happens very naturally.
Pat Walravens: Okay. So, there's not a near-term hit on cash flow, like you don't get less cash upfront when you go to a consumption model? I mean, maybe not...
David Jolley: No. I mean still AIA...
Josh James: subscription.
David Jolley: Yeah, subscription AIA. So...
Pat Walravens: Okay. Perfect. And then, my second question is, Josh, if you could go a little deeper -- actually, I'm able to tell you my other two question, I'll put them up out front. So, for Josh, if you could go a little deeper on the architectural change and help us understand the history of that, what was it before and what is it now and how does it work? And then, maybe if you guys could address the debt in a little more detail, just sort of what's the current rate, when's the current -- when's the maturity and what's your options look like? Both of those things would be really helpful. Thank you.
Josh James: Yeah. So, the problem before, when we were starting to get excited about the ecosystem and we were building relationships with some folks, especially the big data providers, we'd walk into accounts with reps, and then their customer that they introduced us to might start pulling some compute out of our partner and putting it into Domo. And of course, that's the end of those relationships, right? You're taking dollars out of the pockets of the reps of the partners. And so that was DOA as soon as that started. And so, what we've done now is we said, okay, we can take that compute component, where the data lives and how it gets queried and processed, and we can run that inside Snowflake or inside AWS or inside Microsoft. So, any partner that brings us in, we can keep all the computing charges and credits that are being used up actually with the partner. And so that changes the dynamic pretty meaningfully because now we have complete alignment except for instead of 40 users that you may have at -- even a big Fortune 500 company, from 40 users or 100 users to 5,000, 10,000, when you add the Domo front-end on top of that. And that's 5,000 and 10,000 people that are now querying and running reports that are all driving compute on the back-end of a Snowflake or a Databricks or a Microsoft or an AWS or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). So, we feel like we're in a much, much better position. And that coupled with premium, there's been plenty of conversations where we're talking to a partner and someone that maybe we have 300 customers that have connected to their data. So, we know it's popular inside our network and we know that we provide a lot of visibility into the data that's inside that partner's analytics and the partner will come to us and say, ""Gosh, it'd be great if we could give this to the other 10,000 customers that we have."" And then we say, ""Yeah, great. You should do that. It's, let's see, $840,000."" And the partners like, ""What? Well, we don't know the values yet."" We're like, ""Yeah. But we will give you upside if they converted to the Domo customers."" They're like, ""Yeah, that seems like a good idea on paper, but I don't know if we can lean in and make the commitment, make the investment without seeing a return. So, maybe we should just try it out with a couple of customers."" And by then, you've lost momentum. Whereas now, we can go in that same customer, that same conversation, we say, ""Yes, we can get it to all 10,000. Let's do it on freemium. Let's build some quick start guides so that the second you roll this out, the customer is able to log into Domo, see all of the data from you as a partner. We'll build out the dashboards. We'll build out the alerts."" They're going to get this great white-glove, perfect experience replicated 10,000 times automatically. And in there, they can see, ""Hey, this is your Domo experience for this data from your partner. If you want it for everything else, here's your freemium account, just keep going."" And then, we tell the partner, ""Any upside, we're going to give you guys a piece of it."" So all of a sudden, providing data to their customers becomes not a cost center, it becomes a profit center. And we've seen a bunch of traction in just even the last month for that. So, we're really excited about our ability to provide Domo Everywhere through our freemium offering.
Pat Walravens: Great. And then, Dave, on the debt?
David Jolley: Yeah. So, our current debt, as you might recall, we raised that debt even prior to our IPO when we were still using a lot -- consuming a lot of cash. And so, it's very expensive debt. It carries a cash interest component and a PIK interest component, some other payments that push the effective interest rate north of 14% is where we're at today. And it's got a maturity of April '25. And so, we've gone out with a refinancing and got a bank helping us, and we're looking at cash interest component of a little over 11% right now based on where SOFR is at. We're hearing some good things about where rates might go next year, but it'll bring our rate down substantially and push our maturity date out to '29 or '30. So, it sort of puts it out well out into the future and it eliminates some of the other PIK interest and some of the other elements.
Pat Walravens: All right, terrific. Thanks to both of you.
Operator: One moment everyone, the speaker line has disconnected. One moment we reestablish the audio. Once again, everyone, please stand by. We'll establish that audio line momentarily. Please stay on the line. Once again everyone, you are on hold for the Domo, Inc. conference call. We are establishing the speaker line. Please stand by. You are now live.
Josh James: All right. Sounds like Pat said thanks, we heard, and there was another question. Is the question still on?
Operator: Yes. One moment. We'll take our next question from Derrick Wood with T.D. Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thanks. This is Cole on for Derek. On the RIF that you talked about, we'd just like to get a little bit more color. Is that across sales, G&A? If you can just unpack that a bit, that'd be helpful.
Josh James: Yeah, we -- it was across every department. There was -- the majority of it was in sales. We're in terms of growth, not where we want to be. And so for the most part, it was based on performance. Some of it was just positions that were eliminated, as we found a more optimized way of accomplishing certain things. It wasn't a huge number, but it was still several dozen humans that were affected. So, a little bit of a rough day here at the office, but at the same time, I feel like the company is in a better position. And it's not a dramatic effect on our ability to produce. We think in many cases, actually, taking a smaller number of leads distributed -- I mean, taking the same number of leads distributed to a smaller number of reps will actually be an improvement for the reps that are here to make sure that they're being fed. So, overall, I don't think it's going to be too impactful to our company. It just, obviously, impacts the folks that were affected by it.
Unidentified Analyst: Sounds good. Helpful. Just building on that too, for the reps that you still have at Domo, how is productivity trending? Any new initiatives around helping them sell consumption better would be helpful to hear about things.
Josh James: Yeah, we have all kinds of initiatives around helping them to consumption. We had a Board meeting just recently and walked through our consumption deck and showed the Board members all the positive things that are happening and all the negative things that we might be able to find as well. And the resounding answer was -- from the Board was, ""Move as fast as you possibly can. We don't see anything that would cause us concern about you moving as fast as you possibly can."" So, to that end, doing as many things as we can to drive the transition to consumption, things like we've built out a brand new adoption group that's focused on going into our -- especially our bigger customers, and helping them, it's a great phone call. We call a customer, and we're not asking for a new contract. We're not asking to go get approval from procurement. We're just walking in saying, ""Hey, we'd love to come in and show you best uses for data science,"" or ""We'd love to come in and talk to you about identifying opportunities inside your marketing spend."" And they love those conversations. All we're doing is walking in and helping them, but we're helping them identify additional use cases, which, of course, ends up driving consumption. So those are the types of things that we're doing with the customer. And then, we're re-evaluating the different departments that we have and what each group does. So, reps, their job on renewal. What's what is the job on renewal? Is the job to go and procure another contract, or is the job to help identify some more use cases? And so, just identifying those different ways that we can interact with our customers to help get them excited about adding additional users and adding additional use cases. It's really fun for the customer, and it's really fun for us. They end up happier. They end up spending more. And those are the types of things that we can really do to address transitions to consumption. There are some customers that are on seat-based licenses with us, and they don't have access to all the features. We have new features rolling out all the time, and if you want to use those features, then you need to be on consumption. And so, as we go out and market the different product offerings that we have and the new product offerings that we have, those all lead to additional consumption conversation. So, we're definitely laser-focused on that. We've seen this 20% cohort of consumption that's in our business today. And it looks better than every other 20% cohort that you could find. So, we're going to do anything and everything we can to get the entire business moved over to that because just everyone ends up happier on the consumption model.
Unidentified Analyst: Appreciate the color. Thanks.
Josh James: Yeah, you bet. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.
Sanjit Singh: Yeah, thank you for squeezing me in. And sorry, I've been toggling between multiple calls, so if I'm repeating a question, I apologize upfront. But David, just given the -- sort of the refinancing of the debt and sort of the higher rate environment and given the sort of actions you guys are doing today on cost, to what extent could debt pay down be part of like the capital allocation strategy, given that the budget environment is still pretty constrained right now? How do you look at debt pay down a potential lever for increasing sort of the equity value?
David Jolley: Yeah. I mean the good thing is even sort of as is with a very modest growth expectation for next year, I think we're free cash flow positive, which puts us in a great position. So, if we're able to accomplish some of the things that Josh talked about in accelerating our shift to consumption, and if we get any sort of help from the macro environment, then we're into producing some meaningful cash flow that then could be used to potentially retire some debt. As you know, there's usually some penalties when you pay it down in the first year. So, we'll look at that. But I think it'll be -- probably will be a lot better position as we move into some of those succeeding years to start reducing that well in advance of maturity, certainly.
Sanjit Singh: Great. I appreciate the thoughts. And then, Josh, on -- I was just kind of coming out of the AWS conference, and when I hear about people's data strategies, one of the bigger themes is sort of English being the new programming language and English being the new SQL. And just want to get a sense of how you guys are sort of abstracting away kind of traditional BI type user interfaces to more of that generative AI modality where users are just sort of using natural language, English, to get the insights that they need from Domo?
Josh James: Yeah, I mean it's terribly exciting because one of the most challenging things in business intelligence or in leveraging the data that you have in your company is just getting access to it. And the big part of getting access to it is connecting to it, all of the ETL that needs to go into it. And you're right, that's where these antiquated languages used to be a big part of it. And going forward, it is about English. And we have a bunch of stuff that we've already incorporated into our products, a bunch of AI that we've incorporated into our product, and a bunch of generative AI that we're going to be incorporating over the next few months into exploring the data, into building cards, into sharing data, having a data set and having AI suggest to you what you should look at, what format it should look like, being able to pick and choose from things that it suggests to you, fully formed reports. And so, it's going to dramatically alter the landscape. It's going to dramatically alter the interactions and the benefits that the customers get. So, we're really excited about that. We feel like we're extremely well positioned. When you look at the data that powers AI, it all depends on how organized that data is. And if your data is organized like a bunch of trash, then that's exactly what you're going to get back. When you use Domo, you actually not only organize your data, but you have a bunch of metadata about that data. And that's what helps AI really come up with great conclusions when it actually has an indication of what type of data is sitting there because in the data world it could be anything. It could be unstructured, messy data, and it might be data that's coming from another data warehouse. You actually don't know the root source of it, and so you need to be able to have the metadata around that and have data organized in a way. And that's one of the things that we really do with our customers, is help them organize that so that they can take advantage of all the different technologies and innovations that are rapidly coming out from AI. So, we feel like we're extremely well positioned for that. And that's another big part of why we want to be in the middle of consumption, because again, if you're using consumption, anything that is in our product, you can try out. It's going to cost you a buck to try it out. It's not a $50,000 commitment and you've got to buy a couple seats. It's just go and click on it, see what it does, see if it produces something that's effective. And then, if it does, of course, you're going to start using it more. And because you already know it's effective, even though you're using it more, you're getting a bill for it, you don't care because you already proved the value. So that's just another reason why consumption is such an important part of this, where we see 2x, 3x usage of the additional features and functionality we have in our product when it's a consumption customer, because they're able to try it out and prove that it works. So, we're really excited about AI and the way it's going to impact our business, broadly speaking, and feel like we're really well positioned to take advantage of that.
Sanjit Singh: Appreciate the thoughts, Josh. Thank you.
Josh James: You bet. Thanks.
Operator: And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation today, and you may now disconnect.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires TikTok and other designated gatekeepers Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to make their messaging apps interoperate with rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices. They are not allowed to favour their own services over rivals' or prevent users from removing pre-installed software or apps. TikTok last month challenged the EU decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court, saying its designation risks undermining the DMA goal of protecting gatekeepers from newer competitors like itself.

(NYSE:SNOW) reported its Q3 fiscal 2024 earnings, with product revenue reaching $698 million, marking a 34% year-over-year (YoY) growth. The company added 35 $1 million plus customers in the quarter, and nine of its top 10 customers experienced sequential growth. Snowflake also introduced new technologies such as Snowflake Cortex for AI and machine learning, Snowpark Container Services, and Dynamic Tables. The company's Q4 product revenue is projected to be between $716 million and $721 million, with full-year guidance increased to approximately $2.65 billion.
Key takeaways from the earnings call include:Snowflake executives discussed the stabilization of their customer base and evolving sales approach, highlighting the potential impact of new products on consumption and future growth.The company is focusing on enabling AI and machine learning technologies, with a shift in sales approach towards more specialization and teams of specialists.Snowflake announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has positively impacted their business. The company's largest hyperscaler customer is AWS, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform (GCP).The company added two Global 2000 customers last quarter and expects more in the pipeline for Q4.Snowflake expects to see increased consumption as more customers migrate to their platform, particularly in relation to the adoption of Snowpark.The company's product gross margins may face headwinds in Q4 due to the costs associated with new product development and software fine-tuning.During the earnings call, Snowflake executives highlighted the importance of AI and machine learning technologies in driving their business. The company expects the effects of AI to unfold gradually, with incremental workload utilization and consumption growth. The executives also mentioned the upcoming FedRAMP high authorization and the importance of unstructured data and Document AI in driving their business.
Snowflake also discussed the utilization of higher tiers by large enterprises, the impact of AI on the business, consumption trends, container services, go-to-market strategies, unstructured data support, and legacy replatforming. They highlighted the continued migration of on-premise workloads to the cloud and the expansion of workloads within existing customers.
In terms of payment models, Snowflake continues to push for three-year contracts but may offer more flexible payment terms in the future. The company's top 10 customers have shown strong quarter-over-quarter growth, driven by large data estates and workload migrations. The company's product gross margins may face headwinds in Q4 due to the costs associated with new product development and software fine-tuning. However, Snowflake does not anticipate significant upside in their long-term margin guidance.InvestingPro InsightsIn light of Snowflake Inc.'s recent Q3 fiscal 2024 earnings report, several key metrics from InvestingPro provide additional insight into the company's financial health and market position. Snowflake's market capitalization stands at a robust $61.88 billion, reflecting investor confidence in its business model and growth prospects.

Thank you for attending today's Q3 FY 2024 Snowflake Earnings Conference Call. My name is Hannah and I will be your moderator for today's call. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations at Snowflake. You may go ahead.
Jimmy Sexton: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us on Snowflake's Q3 fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me in Bozeman, Montana are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; v, our Chief Financial Officer, and Christian Kleinerman, our Senior Vice President of Product, who will join us for the Q&A session. During today's call, we will review our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, products and features, long-term growth, our stock repurchase program and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2023, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended of 2023 that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations. We'd also like to point out that on today's call, we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To see the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today and our investor presentation, which are posted at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.
Frank Slootman: Thanks, Jimmy. Welcome and good afternoon. Q3 product revenue grew 34% year-over-year to reach $698 million. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $111 million, representing 7% year-over-year growth. Results reflect strong execution in a broadly stabilizing macro environment. while Snowflake's global revenue mix is highly diverse in terms of industries and geographies, the company derives an ever larger revenue share from mainstream enterprises and institutions. This, as compared to a newer crowd of digital natives, have made up many of Snowflake's early adopters. We added 35 $1 million plus customers during the quarter, 9 of our top 10 customers grew sequentially. Generative AI is at the forefront of customer conversations, which in turn drives renewed emphasis on data strategy in preparation of these new technologies. We said it many times, there's no AI strategy without a data strategy. The intelligence we're all aiming for results in the data, hence the quality of that underpinning is critical. Meanwhile, Snowflake has announced and showcased the plethora of new technologies that let customers mobilize AI. We've introduced Snowflake Cortex to leverage AI and machine learning on Snowflake. Cortex is a managed service for inferencing large language models. This opens up direct access to models and specialized operations by translation, sentiment and vector functions. Business analysts and data engineers can now use AI functionality without the fractured highly technical challenges of the AI landscape. Last summer, we introduced Snowpark Container Services, which also serves as the second pillar of our AI enablement strategy. Developers can access any language, any library and flexible hardware inside the governance boundary of Snowflake. More than 70 customers are already using container services in preview with many more waiting in line. Snowflake makes the common AI use case is easy and the advanced use case is possible. We are well positioned for AI based on the scale and scope of our data cloud programmability and governance framework. There are hurdles challenging enterprise adoption of AI and ML. The first is broad access to quality data. Snowflake addresses this challenge through its data sharing architecture. 28% of all our customer share data, up from 22% a year ago and 73% of our $1 million-plus customers are data sharing up from 67% a year ago. AI models can only be as smart as data they are trained on. Security and governance present another challenge for enterprise adoption of AI and the now Snowflake Horizon offers a unified security and governance solution built for AI. Horizon strictly and consistently enforces user privileges on data across use cases, including large language model applications, traditional ML models and ad hoc queries. As part of Horizon, we introduced universal search, which enables customers to search the data cloud. Customers can now discover data and metadata that exists across their accounts and in the Snowflake marketplace. Snowflake continues to win new workloads outside of its traditional. Snowpark's consumption grew 47% quarter-over-quarter. Consumption in October was up over 500% since last year. Over 30% of customers use Snowflake to process unstructured data in October. Consumption of unstructured data was up 17 times year-over-year. Our newest streaming capability, Dynamic Tables entered public preview earlier this year. Approximately 1,500 customers are using the feature and initial adoption is outpacing expectations. We have a number of major new capabilities becoming broadly available in Q4. Our native apps framework will go GA, UniStore for transaction processing, Snowpark Container Services and Apache Iceberg Tables will all enter public preview. These products unlock substantial new workload expansion opportunities. We are campaigning globally to expand our audience. This fall, our Data Cloud World Tour traveled to 26 cities worldwide. In-person attendance at these events reached 23,000 nearly double from last year. Next up is our Build Developer Conference in early December, where we anticipate 35,000 registrations. Build is focused on building apps, data pipelines and AI/ML workflows. We hope to see you there. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. In Q3, we saw strong consumption from a broad base of customers. Our performance was evenly split between large and small accounts largest customer stabilized as expected. Migrations drove growth in Q3. Our two fastest-growing customers who are both migrating workloads from a legacy vendor. One of these accounts is in their second year on the platform, the other in their eighth year on the platform. We added four customers with more than $5 million and two customers with more than $10 million in trailing 12-month product revenue in the quarter. Growth in September exceeded expectations. For three weeks, consumption grew faster than any other period in the past two years. Consumption continued to grow in the month of October. Q3 represented a strong quarter for bookings execution. Remaining performance obligations grew 23% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. Of the $3.7 billion in RPO, we expect 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. APJ and SMB drove growth in net new bookings. We are making significant progress in delivering margin expansion. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 78% was up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Improved terms from the cloud service providers have contributed to margin expansion. We also benefit from increasing consumption of higher-priced additions of Snowflake. In Q3, price per credit increased 4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 10% was ahead of expectations. Operating margin benefited from revenue outperformance and increased hiring scrutiny. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 15%, benefiting from favorable timing of collections. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Our strong cash position allows us to opportunistically repurchase shares. In Q3, we used $400 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares. Year-to-date, we have used $592 million to repurchase 4 million shares at an average price of $147.5. Now let's turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect product revenue between $716 million and $721 million, representing year-over-year growth between 29% and 30%. We're increasing our full-year guidance to approximately $2.65 billion, representing 37% year-over-year growth. Consumption trends have improved. We are seeing stability in customer expansion patterns. Our guidance is based on observed patterns and assumes continued stability of consumption. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating margin of 4% and 360 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full-year, we are increasing our non-GAAP product gross margin guidance. We now expect non-GAAP gross margin of 77%. We still expect a product gross margin headwind in the fourth quarter associated with new products. We are increasing our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP operating margin guidance. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin of 7%. We are increasing our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin. We now expect non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 27%. For the full-year, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 361 million. We are on track to add more than 1,000 employees this year, inclusive of M&A. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark Murphy: Thank you so much. I love the 11-minute earnings call, and congrats on a fantastic result. So Frank, we are hearing broadly that conversations are starting with generative AI and they're stopping at data, because they find their data estates aren't in good enough shape. Are you sensing more tangible uplift there around that concept that Snowflake might be on the front edge of AI projects and perhaps seeing that spill over into customer conversations or drive more pipeline for some of your other products like Snowpipes and Snowpark and data sharing?
Frank Slootman: Generally speaking, yes, one of the interesting things is that customers are now getting preoccupied with their data estates because they have to get them into shape where they can productively take advantage of the newer technologies, which we are now also showcasing and delivering where they can just turn it on and have well-governed frameworks to run them with all the things that they're used to from Snowflake. So it's definitely true that the frenzy and the high degree of interest in AI has a knock-on effect on the interest in data strategy, data platforms. And people are also not just looking at the quality of their data and the optimization of the organization curation of data but also what kind of data they need to be able to have access to. So people are taking a much broader view of their data estates as well in terms of what's in it and what should be in it.
Mark Murphy: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Our next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you guys. [Indiscernible] on for Keith. Maybe just start off with a quick question on sort of you mentioned several times on the call, the stabilization that you are seeing in your -- with the new growth. And we've obviously heard that from sort of your hyperscaler peers as well. When you're looking at an account level, could you give us sort of an idea like how much of the stabilization is coming from cost optimization, scrutiny alleviating versus sort of existing customers who slow what migrations leaning in more versus customers leaning more into new products? Is there any way that you can kind of give us more color, what parts are playing out already and which are yet to come maybe into the next year?
Frank Slootman: Keith, one of the things, it is Frank. What I mentioned is our customer base has evolved in recent years to include much larger enterprises and institutions who are typically not prone to over consumption and unbridled expansion that they then later have to reset and rationalize. Because of that, the exposure to these drastic resets and optimization that we saw earlier in the year is getting less and less with each incremental quarter. Secondly, people have really driven themselves through these processes and rationalized themselves and are now in a good place to move forward. You can only optimize and rationalize so much. At some point, it's diminishing returns. People get tired of us and they're moving on to things that are now new and interesting, namely preparing for enabling AI and ML technologies.
Mike Scarpelli: I'll add to that, too, that why we see that stabilization is nine out of our top 10 customers all grew quarterly sequentially. And the other point I'll make is we are seeing a shift, as Frank mentioned. Our biggest customers are mature enterprises we're seeing now and mature enterprises have always scrutinized cost. They always will. And so there's nothing new there, and that will continue. And that's just the way anyone should run a business.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe one quick question on your sales and marketing headcount. Obviously, we noticed it's basically flat quarter-over-quarter this quarter. But then again, it's only sort of one number. Can you shed some light in terms of like what regions are you may be leaning more into versus getting more efficiencies or any sort of areas that you're investing in still? Because obviously, your growth seems pretty healthy. So just some color on where you're investing, would be helpful.
Mike Scarpelli: Yes. So first of all, in general, with sales and marketing heads, most of those typically are added right at the end of Q4 or even more so at the beginning of Q1, so people can get involved in our sales kickoff. And what I would say is we are continuing to invest very heavily in our sales and marketing function, in particular, in Europe. We talked about six months ago or so, we added a new leader there. We have been changing out some people and investing, and we're continuing to, and we will continue to prune underperformers globally and invest more in the right people as we go forward. And APJ is another one that we continue to invest in.
Unidentified Analyst: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Weiss. Our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. You may proceed.
Raimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Guys, you have like a crazy amount of new exciting products coming out. How do you think about the sales setup here now going forward? Because you're going to be able to address lots of different areas from like classic data to kind of more AI. Does that mean your sales approach needs to change, Frank, here going forward? And it doesn't sound like you are going to have a crazy sales force expansion here. Like how do you want to do that going forward and ensure that all these new products are actually finding the market? Thank you.
Frank Slootman: Yes that's actually an excellent observation. We have historically had sort of one dominant selling motion that we sort of deployed everywhere and anywhere. It has served us well. But as you correctly observed, the market has really changed. When you go back to 2015, Snowflake really swam in swim lanes that were very narrowly defined and very well understood. Now we're in the mega market, right? These are very, very broad-based platforms that are incredibly capable in many directions. And we've been working very hard, as you've seen in recent years, in delivering just an absolute ton of capabilities to enable these platforms in all these different directions. I mean, our drive towards applications and the whole programmability framework, the onslaught of AI and AM and our capabilities, all of that is coming to fruition. Now we have a ton of irons in the fire, and they're now all getting hot. So from a sales standpoint, we have much more specialization happening and that is going to literally going all over the world because it is impossible for a single person to be to be expert in all these technologies and all these disciplines. So we're going to have people that have general purpose capabilities, sort of core skills, if you will, and then we will have teams of specialists that will augment these groups wherever they're needed. So our basic selling motions and how they are supported will evolve rapidly in the coming year.
Raimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Lenschow. Our next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Kirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Congrats on the quarter. I guess, Mike, could you just talk about the impact that some of these newer unstructured data workloads are having on consumption at all, meaning I assume it's still a very, very small part of overall consumption when you look at it, but is that helping with the stabilization? Can they turn into sort of catalyst for acceleration as we get into '24? Anything you to sort of dimensionalize the impact that has as we think out to next year? Thanks.
Mike Scarpelli: Well, they're definitely helping with stabilization. I can't quantify exactly what unstructured is doing, but it's not just that. It's also we're starting to see the effects more of Snowpark that's doing very well for us right now. Some of the new things we're already seeing very early uptick in streaming and dynamic tables. We really, I would say, Streamlit is built into our forecast for next year. The other products because they're new, we really don't build much in for that because we need history before we can do that. And clearly, we think a lot of these new products that are just going into public preview now and GA next year will be a catalyst for growth for us in 2025.
Frank Slootman: One follow-on, Kirk. Document AI is a technology that we've been working on for quite a while, and it really was on the basis of an acquisition we did over a year ago. That is now going into preview. And it is incredibly popular out there and what Document AI does returns to an unstructured document into a semi-structure document. So it can become a full participant in analytical processing. There is a ton of interest in that. And so that really brings the entire estate of unstructured data, which is 80% of the world's data into the analytical sphere. So we do expect that to become very important, and especially because AI and LLMs are so heavily focused on unstructured data, textual data, at least today, this will be something that will be a driver in our business.
Kirk Materne: Thanks. And Mike, can you just give us an update on where the federal sort of opportunity stands? I know you guys were waiting to hear back on FedRAMP. Any update on that? Thanks.
Mike Scarpelli: Federal is a huge opportunity, and I would say it's upside for us because it's such a small piece, but we should have our FedRAMP high authorization literally any day. I actually thought I might have had it today. So stay tuned. You'll see an announcement on that very soon.
Kirk Materne: Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Materne. Our next question is from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. You may proceed.
Brad Reback: Great, thanks very much. Just a quick technical question with Graviton 4 now being announced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), should we think of any potential headwinds there?
Mike Scarpelli: Well, as we told you before, every year, we count on a 5% headwind associated with software hardware improvements. Graviton 4 was just announced recently. We really have not tested that and not all hardware improvements benefit our software. We expect there will be some, but we just don't know. It's too early, stay tuned and we'll update you when we have more information.
Brad Reback: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Reback. Our next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Ethan Bruck: Hey, guys. This is Ethan Bruck for Alex Zukin. Congrats on the nice quarter. My question is, if you're assuming the consumption trends persist through 4Q, and that's how you're guiding, I guess, what would be the biggest puts and takes to accelerate growth next year? And in the same vein, when we think about NRR, just given the stabilizing consumption trends, I guess, directionally, when should we think about when would we expect NRR to stabilize trough and around like what level would you expect?
Mike Scarpelli: So I'll start with -- I'm not going to guide to NRR. I do see it stabilizing. It could dip a little bit more. I do expect over time, NRR, as we've said, we'll converge with our revenue growth. at the size we're at. And clearly, the biggest puts and takes for next year is going to be the -- to continue to see the stabilization we have we're seeing right now and what the impact of a lot of our new initiatives are going to be next year, and it's just too early to tell right now and to guide to that. So stay tuned for our February call when we give guidance for next year.
Ethan Bruck: Great. Thank you very much, Scarpelli.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Zukin. Our next question is from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Brent Thill: Thanks, Mike. I think you mentioned there is a higher utilization on the higher tiers that you're offering. Can you just extrapolate what you're seeing there?
Mike Scarpelli: Well, typically, large enterprises are the ones using our business critical in BPS, and those guys are becoming bigger and bigger customers. And as a result, we do see more of our revenue being derived from these very large companies who are using our higher SKU, which has higher margin for us, and that's what we're seeing there.
Brent Thill: Okay. And quickly for Frank, when you think about just the overall AI impact, do you feel that this is a bigger tailwind in the back half of '24? Do you think you'll see it coming in early '24? How are your thought process in terms of adoption in this way, helping you? When does that impact hit from a monetization perspective?
Frank Slootman: There's going to be a lot of nuances to how AI is going to unfold and translate itself into the effects into our business. It's not just like turning on the switch and all of a sudden, you see incremental consumption happening. As we said during the prepared remarks, we're already seeing that the interest in AI is also driving interest in the data strategy, which then has a knock-on effect on consumption. It's also the expansion of the data universe that people are bringing in quality of the data initiatives. All of that is going to bring incremental workload utilization to Snowflake, even though you would normally not necessarily characterize that as AI, but these are things that are going to enable AI, and it might well be that a ton of the workload of AI is actually the proverbial iceberg where only the tip of it that's ticking above the water is really AI, but everything that has to happen to support us is happening below the service then we're going to be a huge beneficiary of that. We think that Snowflake is super well prepared because our data estates are in a very, very advanced state because our customers have spent years, years and years. And in some cases, literally decades from prior legacy platforms to building these estates and curing the data and organizing and optimizing for the data to be completely trusted and sanctioned in their environment, and that is a huge value when you start tackling AI and ML models.
Brent Thill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Thill. Our next question is from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. You may proceed.
Patrick Colville: All right, thank you so much for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you talked of very strong consumption in September. Consumption continued to grow in October. We're now 29 days through November. Can you just talk about trends thus far this month?
Mike Scarpelli: What I would say is trends are good, but you have to remember, it also has a big holiday in the U.S. and the week of Thanksgiving is typically a slow week. With that said, I'm happy with the consumption we're seeing, and that's reflected in our guidance.
Patrick Colville: Perfect, thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Colville Our next question is from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. You may proceed.
Tyler Radke: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about container services. So it sounds like you're seeing some good early momentum there, more than 70 customers in private preview. I'm curious how many of those are actually deploying large language models directly on the Snowflake data? And for those customers that are doing that, what type of uplift or how you kind of characterize that consumption when they do that?
Christian Kleinerman: Yes. This is Christian. Yes, we have seen a variety of use cases, but a good number of those prior preview customers are leveraging GPU instances in silver and payer services for use of large language models. So for sure, it's a meaningful part of the early adoption use cases and we've got lots of encouragement and excitement to continue the rollout of the preview.
Tyler Radke: Great. And just a question on go-to-market. So I think earlier this year, you talked about some execution issues and it seems like that's been partially resolved to get good results in APAC. I guess, do you feel like you have all the right key sales leaders in place at this point? Or are there still some roles you're looking for? And I guess, ultimately, do you feel like you've turned the corner on those execution issues as well?
Frank Slootman: Yes. It's Frank. Look, in a global sales organization that we're running and we're running all the way from an on-demand selling motion that's unattended, if you will, by salespeople to SMB, to an ISB to mid-range large and then the extremely large customers. The -- it's always a work in process. There's always opportunity for improvement. That's been true for as long as I've been here. That said, I feel we're getting incrementally better, stronger, deeper in terms of our ability to sell. We're becoming much more consistent and more and more productive every day. So a lot of stability and a lot of progress. But this is something that's never over. Anybody who's been in this business knows how this works. It's a very dynamic mix of things. But on the whole, we have to, as a company, a $3 billion or something of that order of magnitude run rate, we lean hard on our organization to show up and deliver those results every quarter. So it's becoming a formidable enterprise in terms of our go-to-market capability.
Tyler Radke: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you Mr. Radke. Our next question is from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.
Brent Bracelin: Thank you and good afternoon. Frank, we'll start with you here. I think last quarter, unstructured data was mentioned twice. You've called it out here more than a dozen times. You talked about October trends being up, I think, 17x increase year-over-year. How much of a game changer is this, particularly as we think about Document AI and Snowpark Containers coming out next year? Clearly, a focus here. It certainly hasn't been an area you supported in the past, but it feels like there's a sea change movement here. How much of a game changer is unstructured data support relative to the growth opportunity going forward?
Frank Slootman: Look, unstructured data, as I said earlier, is the majority of the world's data. And until relatively recently, it's been borderline unusable for analytical purposes, because it is unstructured and you can't reference it in analytical workloads. It's ironic that both through the on slide of large language models that is also extraordinarily of dealing with textual data as well as things just Document AI that Snowflake developed, and it's bringing to the market that this data is going to become a full participant in these types of workloads. It's super exciting. It's going to really enriched and really unlock insights and outcomes and all of that we haven't had before. So this is going to be a driver of our world as we know it in terms of this type of computing.
Brent Bracelin: That's helpful. And Mike, if I look at average consumption revenue per customer, those metrics improved on a growth perspective, slightly year-over-year for the first time in over a year. What are the driving factors there? How much of this is just the optimization headwinds now starting to ease versus net new workloads coming on the platform?
Mike Scarpelli: Well, what I would say, and I'll repeat what I've said at numerous times to investors, optimizations are part of our life. They've been happening at Snowflake from day 1, they will continue to happen. Nothing is new with optimization. I don't see any big ones happening now, but that's not to say they won't happen in the future, because history has shown they happen all the time. Most of the growth that we're seeing within our customers is we talked about two of our biggest growth customers was on-prem legacy migrations into Snowflake. So there's initial migrations, but we're also seeing new workload expansion within existing customers as well, too. So it's -- there's no one thing that's driving it. It's just general consumption we're seeing. And I will say Snowpark is starting to kick in for us. Still not 10% of our revenue. That's a long ways to get there, but it's still meaningful for us.
Brent Bracelin: Great to hear, thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Bracelin. Our next question is from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Derrick Wood: Great. Thanks. I guess I wanted to dovetail off of that on-premise legacy migrations. And I guess for Frank, I mean, when we saw the macro hit, I think it did cause a slowdown in customers looking to re-platform from on-prem to cloud. Just curious, I mean, I know you guys are kind of highlighting the consumption trends improving here. But wondering what you're seeing in the pipeline for new Global 2000 accounts? And if you're seeing legacy replatforming initiatives start to kick back up now that the macro environment has gotten a little bit more stable?
Frank Slootman: Well, I mean, there's no doubt that the legacy replatforming is sort of the hardcore of our business. And almost surprisingly there is just an enormous amount of workloads still sitting on-premise that is still waiting to get migrated to the cloud. So I expect this to continue for a very long period of time. But as what Mike's said is very important. Once you get those data states into the cloud, our new architectures and our new technologies are now enabling opportunities that people haven't had before. And so that drives workload expansion. So it's not just like, okay, we're going to be doing in the cloud where we used to be doing on-premise, and that's the foundation of the business. It is definitely foundational but the opportunity is really what grows from that. That's been the Snowflake story from day one because of what's now possible. We don't have the capacity constraints and people can run unlimited numbers of workloads. And now with all the new technologies in terms of programmability, AI and sky is the limit. I mean, in our conversation with customers, I was telling us is that your problem is no longer the technology. Your problem is your imagination and your budget, right? Not that those are easy things, but technology is not holding us back anymore. It's our ability to harness the technology. And then, of course, you have to pay for it as well.
Mike Scarpelli: Yes. I'll just add to that, Derrick, too, on your question about Global 2000. Yes, we added two Global 2000 last quarter. And as I've said many times before, selling into a Global 2000 as a campaign, it's a one to two, sometimes three year sales cycle. With that said, we have a number of Global 2000 in our pipeline for Q4. And what I also want to see, too, is not every Global 2000 starts with an on-prem migration. Many of them start with a first-gen cloud solution they had purchased to migrate to Snowflake. Yes, almost all of them have an on-prem estate, but that doesn't always happen at first. It really varies by customer. But with that said, we still see a lot of on-prem migration to be done over the coming years, and it's going to be for many, many years.
Derrick Wood: Got it. And Mike, a follow-on for you, really around RPO. And we've heard of more companies looking to take a pay-as-you-go approach. So could you speak to what extent customers are shifting to that approach versus annual or multiyear commits and how that may play into your RPO growth trends looking forward?
Mike Scarpelli: No. I don't see that, that much. The only time you see pay-as-you-go are ones who had signed a 3-year contract and then they run out of capacity. And then they just pay as they go. Actually, one of our top 10 customers is like that. They have until April to continue before they have to do another contract, if they want to get the same pricing that they have. I actually expect Q4 is going to be a pretty significant bookings quarter with a number of renewals that are up or customers are going to do something. And we continue to push for three-year contracts with our customers. Payment terms, I do expect though that is one of the things I'd rather give up on payment terms and discount to price per credit. And that's really, I've said it all along, I anticipate longer term, customers will want to do more monthly in arrears payment terms, and that is available to customers. It all comes down to what price you want to pay per credit. And to date, most people want the lower price per credit and are willing to pay annually in advance.
Derrick Wood: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Wood. Our next question is from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist. You may proceed.
Joel Fishbein: Thanks for my question and congrats on the great quarter. I guess, Frank, this one is for you. Snowflake Summit, you announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft. And I'm just curious how that partnership is going, and you also announced some joint product integration. So I'd love to get an update how that's going and how you feel about that going forward?
Frank Slootman: This is Frank. Yes, we actually saw quite a bit of energy coming from the Azure platform this quarter. The things that we worked on in the renewed relationship with Microsoft is really much better alignment in the field from a compensation standpoint that is just super, super important in our world. And we're seeing the effects of that. And the Microsoft platform really upticked during the quarter. I don't know the exact numbers at hand, but it measurably ticked up. So we're encouraged by the behavior we're seeing in the field, and we're encouraged in the overall sentiment that's developing in the field. So it's definitely healthier than the relationship with Microsoft has been historically. So we're pleased and optimistic about it.
Joel Fishbein: Any milestones we should be looking for there from the partnership?
Frank Slootman: Not really. We'll let you know.
Joel Fishbein: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Fishbein. Our next question is from the line of Mike Cikos -- with Mike Cikos. Please proceed.
Mike Cikos: Thank you for getting me on here. And good to hear some of the earlier comments around Snowpark, which is consistent with some of the growing momentum we've heard in some of our checks. I think the question is probably more for maybe Mike or Christian. But is there enough empirical data or a sizable enough customer base yet for Snowpark to start talking about how these Snowpark customers, I guess, what adoption of Snowpark does for consumption versus non-Snowpark customers? Or maybe how we should think about usage building over time as Snowpark becomes a larger part of those customers' workflows?
Mike Scarpelli: I think it's still too early to tell. I will say -- we have one customer doing a significant migration, which will increase their consumption on Snowflake to roughly $1.5 million a year. And there are a number of those that we've identified in POCs, but we haven't done the migrations. I see that 1 customer going into production right now, which, by the way, has saved them significantly on their legacy vendor. So clearly, the -- with some customers, it's quite meaningful, the consumption we're starting to see, and we expect that trend will continue into next year.
Mike Cikos: Understood. Thanks for calling that out, Mike.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Sikos. Our next question is from Patrick Walravens with JMP. You may proceed.
Owen Hobbs: Hi, this is Owen Hobbs on for Pat. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the strong quarter. So starting off, I guess, how much consumption comes from the different hyperscalers? Is there 1 that kind of is it split evenly between the three or does kind of have the majority of compute share there?
Mike Scarpelli: No. AWS by far is our biggest, followed by Azure and then GCP. GCP is up to 3% right now. Microsoft Azure is the fastest-growing one, but AWS is still 76% of our business with Microsoft being 21%. As I said, GCP is 3%. And I will tell you, 1 of the reasons why GCP is not as big as just so much more expensive for our customers to operate in GCP than it is in AWS and Azure. And as a result, our salespeople are really not inclined to do much in GCP.
Owen Hobbs: Thank you. And then going bigger picture, maybe this is a question for Christian as well. How is the role of the data scientist you sort of kind of changed as we move through the era of big data, machine learning and now into AI? And I guess where do you see that going in the future?
Christian Kleinerman: Yes. We see actual interest on both the traditional data science and ML platform. And we've had a number of announcements at Snowflake for those such use cases, but we obviously see lots of interest on generative AI and large language models where we have also expanded obviously capability to do both hosting via Snowpark Container Services, but more seamless inferencing via the new Snowflake Cortex. So we see strong demand from our broad customer base for both types of use cases.
Owen Hobbs: Good. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Walravens. Our next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. You may proceed.
Gregg Moskowitz: All right. Thank you very much. Frank, since you speak with a lot of large company execs, I'm curious to hear any thoughts you have on IT budgets next year as well as whether there will be incremental budget dollars approved for AI in calendar '24 or if the AI spend will primarily or maybe even entirely come from other areas of IT?
Frank Slootman: I don't even hear the words AI and budget in the same sentence. In other words, they're going to make resources available to enable it. But if anything is holding them back is really understanding how to do it. It takes time in tech to mature and evolve deployment architectures where everybody involved is fully confident and comfortable that these are the right ways to do it. So you see a lot of benchmark and compare and contrast experimentation, testing all these kinds of things. And they're going to go through many, many iterations of that. We will as well. And I think that the field will become very proliferated with large foundational models and many, many, many subsector specialized models that are very, very, very deep, but also are very, very narrow in purpose. So it is going to become an enormous field. I will tell you that when you talk to the C-suite in large enterprises, people are looking for a reset of economics, like, for example, in contact centers, pricing optimization, supply chain management, I mean, really very, very big impact opportunities. These are not sort of marginal incremental and that has the attention. Data has always had a promise, but it's really on steroids now under the influence of the newer technologies that we're all excited about.
Gregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. And then for Mike, really encouraging, of course, to hear that for three weeks, consumption grew faster than any other period over the past two years. Over which three weeks though, did you see that particularly strong consumption? Was that post Labor Day? Or did it span a different time period?
Mike Scarpelli: Post Labor Day.
Gregg Moskowitz: Right, Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Moskowitz. Our last question is from the line of Will Power with Baird. You may proceed.
Will Power: Okay, great. Thanks. Mike, you referenced that nine of your top 10 customers, it sounds like we're nicely quarter-over-quarter. I guess I wonder, were there any common use cases or products or common threads kind of driving that? Any other color behind the strength there?
Mike Scarpelli: No, these are just all very large customers with massive data estates that continue to -- one was doing a big migration, but the others are just continuing to move workloads to Snowflake.
Frank Slootman: That's very industry-specific as well.
Will Power: Okay. And maybe just a quick question on product gross margins. Last couple of quarters, you're kind of already at your longer-term target, I think. It sounds like there may be a couple of headwinds there in Q4, but is this kind of the general level to expect going forward? And maybe any color on kind of the upside surprise, I guess, if you will, given it seems like you've gotten there faster than you might have expected?
Mike Scarpelli: Yes. I don't really see a lot of upside in our long-term guidance and for a number of reasons. The big headwind that we're seeing this quarter to our margin is with all these new products, that are going into public preview. We have to start to amortize the costs associated with the software development costs that we're required to capitalize under GAAP that are now going to start to be amortized on top of that. In particular, something like Unistar, a lot of times when we introduce new products, many times, we actually have negative contribution margins until it takes us usually up to half a year to nine months to actually fine-tune the software to get the -- to take costs out of operating those new features. And so we just have so many new products that are coming out this quarter that is going to have a headwind on the margin.
Will Power: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Power. That concludes the question-and-answer session as well as today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

[Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kris Newton: Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I’ll now turn the call over to George.
George Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q2 improved on our solid start to FY 2024 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance while our operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. We remain relentlessly focused on managing the elements within our control while driving better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive results from these actions, with increased profitability and a stronger position for delivering long-term growth. In Q2, we held our INSIGHT user conference where I witnessed the tangible excitement for the silo-free innovation, our unified data storage provides. It was invigorating to be with the thousands of attendees and hear stories of the extraordinary outcomes NetApp delivers for our customers. NetApp is at the forefront of the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers turn disruption into opportunity with intelligent data infrastructure. Today’s organizations need storage infrastructure that harnesses the power of public and hybrid clouds while keeping data secure and protected from ransomware attacks. They need infrastructure that supports dynamic workloads like AI, cloud-native, and open-source applications. And they need infrastructure that helps to create more sustainable data centers. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, that supports any application, any data type, and spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments. This comprehensive architecture delivers unparalleled simplicity of management, simplicity of deployment, and consistency of automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. We further elevate the customer experience with our BlueXP sustainability dashboard and NetApp Advance a common set of programs and guarantees that include Storage Life Cycle program, which removes the burden of upgrade cycles as well as storage efficiency, ransomware recovery and data availability guarantees. Intelligent data infrastructure combines unified data storage, integrated data services, and intelligent operations, so customers can operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unify their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Looking at the results of the quarter, momentum from new products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year drove 10% quarter-over-quarter growth in hybrid cloud segment revenue to $1.4 billion. Our all-flash array business benefited from the growth of the AFF C-Series increasing 14% from Q1 to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.2 billion. The AFF C-Series all-flash array continues to exceed our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. In the quarter, we successfully competed against an all-flash competitor with C-Series to win a $16 million deal at an Infrastructure-as-a-Service company. The customer was looking for new storage to host a broad variety of critical applications. Our ease of management for large storage environments, unique data resilience, common toolkit across all our storage systems and the right price performance ratio secured our win despite the competitor's attempt to use price once they realize their value proposition was insufficient. ONTAP One, our all-in-one software license that gives customers access to the industry's most comprehensive data management suite has laid the groundwork to future tech refresh and expansion opportunities. Building on the success of the C-Series, we introduced blocked optimized and AI-ready visions. The ASA C-Series family is a solution tailored to deliver high-performance and guaranteed high availability storage for critical applications, databases and VMware (NYSE:VMW) infrastructure, coupled with capacity flash to make enterprise-grade block storage more affordable and sustainable than ever. We added the AFF C-Series to the ONTAP AI architecture, lowering the overall cost of entry to scalable AI without sacrificing performance. Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering is also growing rapidly. In Q2, we added performance and availability guarantees to Keystone, expanding on the existing sustainability and storage efficiency guarantees, creating a comprehensive program to keep storage operations running optimally. We also announced NetApp storage on Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) Metal, powered by Keystone, providing customers with a single subscription to a full stack of compute, networking and storage infrastructure with low-latency interconnection to all major public clouds. Turning to Public Cloud. As we said last quarter, our priority is growing first party cloud storage services. We aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners’ go-to-market structures at the start of the fiscal year and are seeing new customer additions and growth in those services. However, that growth has been masked by weakness in subscription services, which have declined to 23% of Public Cloud ARR. During the quarter, we engaged in a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio. As a result, we will continue to prioritize cloud storage offerings delivered through the hyperscalers, while refocusing some services, such as Cloud Insights and Instaclustr, to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings, creating greater differentiation and additional value for customers. We will integrate other services that are sold as standalone subscriptions today, such as data protection, into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes. We will also carefully manage the transition of cloud storage subscription services to align to customer preference for consumption offerings. And, we have decided to exit the SaaS backup and virtual desktop services. We anticipate ARR headwinds of approximately $55 million from exited services and unrenewed subscriptions in the second half of fiscal year '24. Growth in first party and marketplace services are expected to partially offset this decline, positioning us to enter FY '25 with a more focused and much healthier business from which to grow. Now to the results of the quarter. Public Cloud segment revenue in Q2 was $154 million, flat from Q1 and up 8% year-over-year. Our first party and marketplace offerings are highly differentiated and are tightly aligned with customers’ buying preferences. These services grew over 30% from Q2 a year ago. We continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as increases in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR in this part of the portfolio. In Q2, we extended our partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with the introduction of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. Now, we are not only the only vendor to have a natively integrated storage service in the public cloud, but we are natively integrated into all three of the leading hyperscale vendors. And we are not standing still with this advantage. Just two months after introducing the GCNV service, we announced the availability of a new lower-cost tier of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, expanding the offering to address a greater range of workloads. These partnerships uniquely position and enable us to participate in the innovation and adoption of AI services in the public cloud. As examples, during Q2, we announced support for Google Cloud’s Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) AI with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, as well as cross-protocol, hybrid cloud AI pipelines on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) FSx for NetApp ONTAP with support for SageMaker Studio notebooks. Our position with the hyperscalers also enables us to displace legacy on-premises competitors as customers migrate workloads to the cloud. A U.S.-based medical equipment company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to replace a competitor’s SAN systems when they moved their database workloads to the cloud. This is the customer’s first engagement with NetApp. Following a successful initial deployment, they are evaluating FSxN for workload consolidation and disaster recovery. Looking forward, our focus is clear and is delivering results. We expect the momentum we saw in Q2 to continue through FY '24, despite continued softness in the demand environment due to the challenging macro. Customers value our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure, and data management which enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely, and sustainably. With recent innovations that enable us to address a broader set of markets more efficiently, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. I’ll now turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Berry: Thank you, George and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a very solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging macro environment with soft IT spend. Our relentless focus and consistent execution delivered results that met and exceeded our guidance ranges and drove record-setting non-GAAP profitability measures across consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our modern, innovative solutions are resonating with customers and our disciplined operational management drove profitability margins to a record high. As we look ahead, we expect our industry leading solutions and unwavering focus to drive revenue growth and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year. Q2 consolidated gross margins of 72% were at an all-time high, driven by product gross margin of 61%, also at an all-time high. Gross margin leverage and the returns on our strategic investments drove record operating margins of 27% and record EPS of $1.58. During the quarter, we returned approximately $403 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing share count by 4% versus Q2 '23. Over the course of the year, we expect to return at least 100% of free cash flow to stockholders. Given our growth, profitability and working capital improvements, we expect operating cash flow for the full year to normalize and track relatively in-line with net income for the full year. Due to our solid execution and operational efficiencies, we outperformed the second quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year. As a result, we are raising all our guidance measures for fiscal year '24. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q2 billings of $1.5 billion decreased 9% year-over-year, and revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 6% year-over-year, as IT budgets remain constrained in a challenging macro environment. Adjusting for the FX tailwind of 160-basis-points, billings and revenue would have decreased 11% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 7% year-over-year, and product revenue of $706 million decreased 16% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, the first half of fiscal year '23 revenue, and most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog entering fiscal year '23. For the second half of fiscal year '24 year-over-year comparisons should be more apples-to-apples. Support revenue, an attach to our install base and indicative of the value of our products, grew 3% year-over-year to $623 million. We are pleased with the momentum of our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives implemented at the start of fiscal year '24. Public Cloud revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $154 million and was relatively flat from Q1 '24. As George noted, year-over-year growth was driven by hyperscaler first party and marketplace services, partially offset by continued declines in subscription services. Now, for our operating results. Q2 consolidated gross margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 72% and product gross margin increased 1,080 basis points year-over-year to 61%. Product gross margin benefited from three main factors: Number one, a mix shift to higher margin and higher capacity products. Number two, favorable COGs stemming from lower component costs and our strategic purchase agreements for NAND. Number three, price discipline in a cost sensitive, competitive pricing environment. I want to be very clear on this point: there were no unusual or one-time transactions that drove the higher product gross margin results. As we discussed in prior calls, we continue to make strategic purchase commitments to lock-in NAND pricing and mitigate margin pressure from rising prices in the future, as NAND prices largely bottomed out in Q2. Operating expenses of $706 million were flat year-over-year and grew $3 million quarter-over-quarter. Within a relatively consistent OpEx envelope, we will continue to reallocate investments to areas of higher opportunity to drive long-term growth. In Q2 operating margin increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 27%, which includes 80 basis points of FX tailwind. EPS grew 7% year-over-year to $1.58, which includes a $0.07 FX tailwind. These record results demonstrate the strength of our business model, product relevance and unwavering focus and execution. As expected, Q2 operating cash flow of $135 million was impacted by seasonally lower collections and repatriation tax payments. DSO was 46 and inventory turns were 15. More importantly, year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million grew 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 8% the same period a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $97 million, bringing the year-to-date amount to $515 million, up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $403 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $230 million in net cash. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q2 was $4 billion. The slight decline year-over-year is driven by lower multi-year support and public cloud subscription billings. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. Given the success of our product portfolio and consistent execution on operational improvements, we are raising our fiscal '24 guidance in still a soft IT spending environment. We now expect fiscal year '24 revenue to be down approximately 2% year-over-year, an improvement from our previous guidance. We expect to see continued strength in product and hyper-scaler first-party and marketplace services, as we work through minor headwinds from public cloud subscription services. Consolidated gross margins are expected to be approximately 71%. For the second half, we expect product gross margin to range between 58% to 60%, driven by continued mix shift to all-flash products and taking into account the current pricing environment and our commitment to maintain pricing flexibility. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 26% and EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25 with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $30 million and share count of 212 million. Operating cash flow is expected to move in-line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. In Q3, we expect revenue to range between $1.51 billion and $1.67 billion, which at the midpoint implies an increase of 4% year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins to be roughly 71%, and operating margin to be approximately 28%. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.74. In closing, I want to thank our customers, employees and investors once again for their steadfast commitment and investment in NetApp. I remain confident in our ability to manage the elements in our control and focus our key priorities to help customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud journeys. Our portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments, and we are committed to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?
Kris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Operator, we'll begin the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my question. Two quick follow-up. Given the updated fiscal year '24 revenue guide, should we assume that the July product revenue of $590 million was essentially the bottom and you would continue to see a sequential improvement in the second half? And the second question has to do with and momentum with some of these higher margin, higher capacity to product. To what extent should we assume these market share has enabled you to ride out a tough IT spend environment?
George Kurian: I'll take the second one, and then Mike can take the first, maybe. We feel very good about the momentum with our C-Series portfolio, we are able to serve customer workloads and use cases, particularly at time of soft IT spending where we are aligned to the value that we bring. And the software value of ONTAP is particularly useful in these all-flash configurations. We are also expanding the total addressable market with the all SAN Array configuration of the C-Series and of the high-performance flash products. So I'm excited about what the future holds for our flash business, and it is because of that momentum and the focus of our go-to-market that we've taken up our guide for the full year.
Mike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, Mehdi. On your question on product revenue, certainly for fiscal '24 implied in the guidance is continued growth in – or growth in the second half for the product line. Total revenue growth averages about 4% for the second half. We have not guided for fiscal '25 yet, but we certainly would -- we feel good about going into '25 as it relates to our product portfolio and our operational improvements.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Kris Newton: Thanks Mehdi. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. Yes, ma'am. And our next question comes from Meta (NASDAQ:META) Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. A couple of questions. Just one, realizing that you're saying there's no major contributor to the gross margin upside. But just how do you see NAND prices increasing, just an outlook on how you see gross margins developing throughout the year and whether these are sustainable? And then just as a second question, do you attribute the more confident in the year to the early success that you're having with C-Series? Do you attribute it to signs you're seeing coming out of INSIGHT? Just what gives you more confidence on the year just given the dampened environment? Thanks.
Mike Berry: Hi, Meta. This is Mike. I'll take the first one, and then George will take the second one. So the comment in the script was specifically related to no one-time transactions that drove the overachievement product margins. As we look forward through the rest of fiscal '24 and '25. And let's start with the second half of '24, we're currently guiding product gross margins between 58% and 60%. As we all know, we continue to benefit from the lowest component costs we've seen in many years. We have included some room in our guidance to be flexible in pricing as well as mix and capacity. And as we've all seen from the industry analyst reports, we do expect that component pricing has bottomed out in our Q2 and will rise as we go throughout the rest of '24. We do feel very good about our position for the rest of the fiscal year as it relates to purchase agreements that we have struck as well as prebuy. Similar to '24, we are looking to extend that into '25, and we'll continue to work with our suppliers as we go through the rest of the year. I'd also note that, hey, historically, we all know storage industry pricing evolves as component pricing changes, and we expect that trend to continue. So, all that being said, we feel good about the second half of '24, as we've included in our outlook. As we head into '25, we'll see how things progress as it relates to mix, pricing and component costs and will guide '25 when we get to our Q4 call. With that, I'll hand it to George.
George Kurian: With regard to your question on the underlying factors that support our optimism in the guide. First of all, from a macro perspective, it's still a challenged macro with the soft demand environment. We saw incremental improvement in North America, but equally a deceleration in certain parts of Europe, mirroring the economic landscape in the public domain. I think within the large enterprise, we see a case-by-case situation in terms of demand and we continue to see a more robust product business in this commercial or mid-market customer base. So, no real fundamental change in the demand environment. With regard to the two underlying factors for confidence. One is, we are a much more focused go-to-market organization, and we are seeing the second consecutive quarter of pipeline and performance from the changes we made at the start of the fiscal year. And so I want to credit our go-to-market teams for their focus and the results that they have delivered this quarter, and that is one of the key contributors. The second is the really strong performance of our all-flash portfolio. We talked in the prepared remarks about a large competitive win against a purely flash competitor. And we see that across multiple segments where we are seeing competitive wins with our portfolio. So those are the two fundamental reasons: go-to-market focus and execution and confidence in our portfolio.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Actually I have two questions for George. George, first one, kind of like what are the lead times for the storage products today? And what does that imply for your visibility when you look into calendar '24? And the second question is, curious whether on a storage content per customer, does it – have you seen any increase in it because of AI? Or do you think that will happen maybe at some point in the future? Or is there any way to put some time lines around it?
George Kurian: With regard to lead times, we are at normal lead times for our portfolio, and we reached those normal lead times a few quarters ago. With regard to the question on storage demand for AI, listen, I think we have been in the AI business for predictive AI or industrial AI for five years. And there are large data sets that are built out to support training of those models and the implementation of those models across the enterprise. So we have a good and robust business there. We are starting to see early signs of trials and use cases with generative AI. Generative AI is particularly well suited for NetApp's capabilities because it operates on unstructured data, files, documents, video, audio and so on. And so we have large repositories of those and customers, and we are able to use that data set and add to that data set to support AI use cases. This quarter, we won a large AI implementation at a very large U.S. bank that was really focused on generative AI document summarization analysis and so on, and we are the infrastructure foundation for that. So it will take time for generative AI to become a demand driver. We are seeing early positive signs there.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, George.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.
Steven Fox: Hi. Good afternoon. I had two questions on the product business. So first of all, I'm not fully understanding what you're saying about the pricing environment. At one point you said, you maintained disciplined pricing and then at another point you would be flexible going forward with pricing. So can you sort of give us a sense for how challenging or not challenging it is to hold pricing in these gross margins? And the second one is related to the product gross margins. I'm just still trying to get a sense for how sustainable this last quarter and the guidance for the next quarter is in terms of product gross margins, even if we adjust for the changes in NAND pricing? Thanks.
George Kurian: Listen, on pricing, we've been in this industry for a very long period of time. And while there will be people who are vendors who are aggressive in any particular transaction or other, depending on their own strategic reasons. Overall, we don't see fundamental changes in the pricing environment. Clearly, the room with lower component costs gives you an opportunity to do more in terms of pricing flexibility. But I think that our past quarter's gross margin results our demonstration of the fact that we've been able to maintain pricing discipline at a time where demand is soft, and it talks to both the differentiation of our product portfolio and the execution in our field teams. I'll have Mike talk a bit about your second question.
Mike Berry: Thanks, George. And I'll refer to George's comments, Steve, when I talk about the sustainability. So as -- so we finished at 61% product margins in Q2. We guided a range of 50% to 60% in the back half. We feel very good about our component costs and the view of that for the rest of our fiscal '24. The reason why we guided slightly lower than Q2 from a margin perspective, that's exactly what George talked about, which is we feel really good about our pricing discipline in our products but we want to make sure and leave room to be flexible should we need that in the second half. That's the one part of the equation that we don't control as much as the cost. So hopefully, that helps. We would not have guided that range if we didn't feel good about it for the second half, Steve.
Steven Fox: Yes. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Citi. Please go ahead.
Asiya Merchant: Great. Thank you. Maybe just a little bit on the macro. Clearly, you're executing really well. And should we -- should we expect slightly better than seasonal growth for you guys in the second half, just given the fact that you guys are ramping on a new product? And then just broadly on the macro, are we starting to see more adoption of flash across the customer base in general as people start to appreciate maybe more pricing being more attractive or is this something that was specific to NetApp just given the success that you're seeing in your C-Series? Thank you.
George Kurian: I'll take the second, and Michael cover the first question. Thank you for the question. Listen, I think that with regard to customer adoption of flash-based technologies, they are -- we saw the high-performance landscape moved to flash several years ago, and there's been a steady movement of that footprint to flash. That is about 15% to 20% of the overall storage market, maybe 20%. The next tranche of use cases are more in the general purpose application footprint. These are in the process of migrating over multiple years. We are in the early innings of that migration. And so we feel very good about the position of our flash portfolio to attack that part of the market. It is essentially the 10K hard drive market that is about 30% to 40% of the hard drive market. So, you'll see that move over time. And so I'll let Mike talk to the first question you had.
Mike Berry: Sure. On your question, Asiya, as it relates to linearity, we did see a nice quarter-on-quarter pickup in Q2 which was really driven by the factors that George discussed. And look at the midpoint of guidance for the year, we do expect it to be relatively consistent with the numbers we like to talk about, which is the 48% in the first half and 52% in the second. Again, keep in mind that the good bit of our revenue, thankfully comes from support, very predictable. Hopefully, we can do a little better, but that is -- the midpoint of guidance is pretty much right on linearity.
Asiya Merchant: Great. Thank you.
Mike Berry: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. I was wondering, George, if you could comment a little bit on a public cloud revenue trajectory in fiscal '24, given some of the changes that you noted? And given those changes in CloudOps, how does that change your long-term revenue outlook for that business on a relative basis, I think before you were thinking 40% of total Public Cloud. Wondering where you're thinking that, that might shake out now in the long-term?
George Kurian: So, let me provide some baseline before I jump into the strategy review takeaways and the implications. First, cloud is roughly 10% of total revenue. Subscription is 23% of cloud revenue, down from about 35% a year ago. So, it's a small percentage of the total cloud revenue and an even smaller percentage of the total company revenue. The mix of Cloud Storage and CloudOps is still relatively consistent approximately 60/40. We focused our strategy review on all elements of our cloud portfolio and had five key takeaways that I outlined in my prepared comments. Sharpening the focus on first-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services. These performed very well in the second quarter and continue to be uniquely differentiated both to end customers of our on-premises solution and a vehicle to acquire net new customers alongside our cloud partners. We would carefully manage the transition of some of the storage subscriptions to our consumption offering as we roll out [1P] services, customers that used to buy storage subscriptions prefer to now go towards the 1P offering, and we'll manage that carefully. We will integrate some standalone services like data protection and privacy into our cloud storage offerings so that they bring more value to the base offering. And we'll refocus other services like Cloud Insights, which are subscription services and Instaclustr to differentiate NetApp in the cloud storage workload motions that we are focused on. We've decided to exit some standalone services like Virtual Desktop and SaaS Backup services. And all of this will lead to about a $55 million ARR headwind from these actions in the second half of fiscal year '24. The reduction in Public Cloud subscription services will be partially offset by the good growth of our consumption cloud storage services in particular. And so our plans for the second half of the year assumes that we will have a modest decline in cloud revenue. We're not going to guide it but we assume that. And we have built that into the guidance for the fiscal year '24, which we took up by approximately $100 million. We're not going to comment today on the outlook for the overall cloud business. We will talk to you when we update our long-term models to that effect.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, George. And if I could, Mike, your margins were really, really strong, both sequentially and on an absolute basis. Wondering as we think about free cash flow margins, would all this EBIT margin improvement flow through into free cash flow margins? And secondarily, just on the EBIT margins, is there a way to dimension out of the three things that you noted, maybe rank order or order of magnitude so that we can get some sense around the confidence of sustainability, especially as it relates to commodity pricing, which you seem to indicate won't really matter too much sequentially. But just wondering what was the biggest sequential driver of that margin improvement? Thank you.
Mike Berry: Sure. So on two questions there. First of all, on cash flow, and I'll do operating cash flow. We do expect for the year, I talked about it in the prepared remarks, operating cash flow to move relatively consistently with non-GAAP net income. So to your question, yes, as the income increases associated operating cash flow, short of any quarterly fluctuations in working capital. So all good there in terms of free cash flow margins largely moving with operating cash flow. And then on the second question, and I'll answer this on a sequential basis, not a year-over-year basis. As we look from Q1 to Q2, certainly, the mix shift was a significant impact. We did receive some benefit on costs as those older inventories are now completely gone. And then, of course, pricing discipline is in there as well. So I would rank from a sequential perspective, the order that I did in my prepared remarks in terms of mix shift, which is both product and capacity than favorable COGS and then pricing discipline. So hopefully, that helps.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Nehal Chokshi: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You guys mentioned 30% growth in first-party storage services. What's the NRR underlying that?
George Kurian: We don't break those out. I think we feel very good about -- we have brought in the number of workloads that we serve. We have brought in the number of hyperscalers now with Google coming online. We have brought lower price points for Azure and Google, and we have brought higher price points for Amazon. So I feel really, really good about the momentum in our first-party cloud storage services.
Nehal Chokshi: Maybe phrasing it in a different way, the driver of that growth is expansion or lands?
George Kurian: The combination of both new customer adds and add new workload use cases within existing customers as well as expansions.
Nehal Chokshi: Great. And then a follow-up, quick question. George, you talked about how you had a $16 million win with the C-Series. And you mentioned four drivers behind that. Much of those four drivers was really probably the biggest element of that win?
George Kurian: Listen, I think we have a really strong operating system capability for performance and simplification at scale. Many of the other vendors that start simple run into real trouble when you try to build a large enterprise environment. And we have a really good portfolio to do that. I think that was probably the number one reason. And the number two reason is now that we have the C-Series, we have a price point to deliver to customers who used to not have it.
Nehal Chokshi: Awesome. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, just a quick clarification. On the strategic review update, I just want to confirm, it sounds like you've concluded that review apart from sort of regular business kind of reviews. I just want to confirm that, that's the case. And then really, the element I'm trying to sort of tease out here is you've taken out $55 million of ARR, so roughly $15 million of revenue, yet your outlook is higher. What is informing the higher outlook? What's been the biggest surprise and the biggest delta contributing to the higher outlook? Thank you.
George Kurian: So first of all, let me hit that in three parts, right? First, we have concluded the strategic review. We have a set of good decisions we've made that we need to now go implement that will result in a more focused cloud business and a healthier subscription base, albeit a smaller one that build off. We believe that these actions should allow us to get back to growth in fiscal year '25 of a healthier business mix in cloud. We always will do reviews of various aspects of our portfolio as ongoing parts of our business. But the focused strategic review, I would say, is mostly complete. I think the second is with regard to the confidence we have. Listen, we said that when we guided the second half of the year, we took up the overall guide by close to $100 million. That is mostly based on the momentum of our all-flash Hybrid Cloud storage portfolio. We've raised the second half guide by substantially more than we beat in the second quarter. And it also accounts for the fact that we will have some headwinds through the rest of fiscal year '24 in our cloud subscription business, which will only be partially offset by growth in our cloud consumption business.
Simon Leopold: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question then comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of those have been asked and answered. But I wanted to go back to some prior discussion around this notion of AI. And we hear a lot about like AI, large language models becoming smaller and implemented more maybe pervasively over time in traditional enterprise environments. We've even heard more about inferencing and how that might evolve in enterprises. I'm just curious, are you seeing at all any signs of that pulling either discussions or early signs of demand? And if so, is it a prerequisite that, that has to pull as all-flash storage with that kind of footprint. And the reason I ask is there's a lot of discussion about a lot of this existing infrastructure that's going to have to be upgraded to support these acceleration of AI in infrastructure? Sorry for the long-winded question.
George Kurian: Yes. No problem. I'll address that in three steps. I think first is the use of smaller models as opposed to the very, very large model. Yes, that term is distillation. We do see that going on in customers, whereas they kind of run these different models, they begin to realize that you can get as effective an outcome with much faster results and a smaller number of parameters. For example, the demonstration, the live demonstration that we showed at NetApp INSIGHT actually was the distillation. We started with a much larger LLM and we brought it to a much smaller range of parameters because you get the same benefit. So that's going on. The second is with regard to training environment, which is the part of the data life cycle in AI where you aggregate a data set and you train the algorithm or the language model for better answers to be able to either predict a good outcome or generate a relevant outcome. You do need very high-performance storage because the GPUs that drive those algorithms need very, very fast parallel access to data. And with our unstructured data scale-out file system, we feel very well positioned for that. And then the third is with regard to inferencing, inferencing is the part of the data life cycle where you've taken a model and now you want to put it into production on our data set could be on a factory floor, could be in a distributed office. There it really depends on the data set and the use case what type of storage you need. You may need it for larger environments like shop floors, but you may not need super high-performance storage and compute for a very small office, like a claim’s office, for example, in insurance.
Aaron Rakers: That's very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, real quickly, who is your predominant competitor that you see on the block optimized C-level all-flash arrays or C-Series arrays?
George Kurian: It's all -- the block market is a crowded market. We feel very good about our offerings in the mid-range, especially and the ability to offer a single solution with common automation, common administration, common life cycle management for both fire and block. And no other vendor in the market can do that. And so we feel very good. I think the large competitors are clearly Dell (NYSE:DELL) and HPE are in the mid-range and then you occasionally see some pure.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess if I start with the Public Cloud strategic review that you discussed, just wanted to clarify, based on the changes you're making there, are there any cost implications other changes? I'm assuming that allows you to focus your go-to-market a bit more, but is there any sort of cost implication where you're enabling some cost take out there? And secondly, Mike, you mentioned sort of the 58% to 60% gross margin on the product revenue in the second half. When we think about, sort of, prebuys that you might do going into fiscal '25, how should we think about the trajectory of the gross margin into fiscal '25. Any levers that you have to offset sort of the flow-through of that to the operating margin that you're really reporting at a very strong level right now? Thank you.
George Kurian: On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources to drive growth in our first-party cloud storage, we feel good about the demand environment there, and we want to continue to accelerate that. Whatever cost opportunities they are, it's been factored into the second half guidance that we gave you.
Mike Berry: Okay. And then thanks for the question, Samik. On the question, especially going into fiscal '25 from the product margin, I'll go over a little bit my answer to Meta when he asked the same question. So as we've all seen from the analyst reports, we have -- we do expect that NAND is largely bottomed. We're at the loss component pricing we've been at in a while. We did a really nice job and kudos to the supply chain team for doing the prebuys and purchase agreements for '24. We will certainly look at those and continue to look at those in '25, but it has to make sense for both NetApp and our suppliers. So as we go into '21, there are certainly some levers. The big question there, Samik that I don't have an answer to is what does the market do and pricing do over the next six months. That's why we're going to wait, will guide the margin number when we guide for the full year because we really want to get through the next couple of quarters to see how component pricing goes, what we expect the mix to be. And then what happens from a pricing environment perspective.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.
George Kurian: On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, George, an inference related question, maybe two quick parts. Are you hearing any of your customers talk about legislation around inferencing, having an impact on their plans? And I guess, just generally speaking, any opinion you have on sort of what that ramp over what time period kind of looks like even. If just anecdotally would be helpful. I appreciate it. Thanks.
George Kurian: Yes. I think, first of all, we are in the stages of generated AI. Predictive AI is quite mature and has very strong use cases. We have done really well in health care and life sciences in manufacturing, in parts of financial services, lots of use cases, right? And so I think that's mature. It requires good data sets and good data management to make it have the right outcome. With Generative AI, there is obviously a lot of discussion on both regulation as well as judicious use of the technology, everything from fairness to epic to privacy to all kind cybersecurity, all of those things. And I think it will take time. Where we are with most clients today is proof of concepts, right? They are trying to put their data sets together, they are trying to learn what these models, will help them do. And there are some use cases which are really easy to see the benefits from software development. It's very easy to see the benefits from, the more advanced ones where some of these concerns exist. They basically customers move cautiously. So it will take time. These are multiyear use case developments. And so we feel good about where we are at the moment, and we're just realistic that will lead time to build momentum.
Ananda Baruah: Yes. Thanks for the context. That’s helpful.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sidney Ho: Great. Apologize if you have already addressed this. On the macro level, are you seeing any major differences between demand from large enterprises, small leading businesses in federal. Any particular verticals you would point out that shows particular strength of weakness both on the Hybrid Cloud and the Public Cloud? Thanks
George Kurian: The demand picture is still soft and mixed. Overall, we saw some improvements in the U.S., offset by some weakness in Europe. Nothing is not in the public domain. With regard to the customer time, large enterprise is still soft. Tech, for example, tech and service provider spending has not really come back. It is really a customer-by-customer situation versus a broad industry situation. With regard to the demand picture in midsized enterprise, our mid-sized enterprise business performed more robustly and secularly better than our large enterprise business. Public sector continues to be a work in progress. We saw some of the impact of the budget negotiations result in softer budgets for certain agencies. Our business performed well, particularly in the civilian agencies.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thank you.
Kris Newton: Thank you, Sidney. I'm going to hand it back to George for some final comments.
George Kurian: In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their strong execution and operational discipline in Q2, which drove revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and record gross margin, operating margin and EPS. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions, helping customers operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unifying their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT sources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Innovation in our all-flash storage portfolio enables us to address a broader TAM and we continue to innovate and lead in Public Cloud storage services. Our go-to-market team is laser- focused on these positions of strength, enabling us to deliver strong results in the challenged macro landscape. Looking ahead, I'm confident that the momentum we saw in Q2 will continue through the remainder of fiscal year '24. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

Rob Enslin: Thank you, Kelsey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our third quarter results underscore the compelling value our end-to-end automation platform delivers for our customers and the strength of our business model. For the quarter, ARR grew 24% to $1.378 billion, driven by a third quarter net new ARR of $70 million, while revenue was $326 million, up 24%. We continue to deliver growth while driving operational efficiencies across the organization. Non-GAAP operating margin increased more than 600 basis points year-over-year to 13%. We also delivered non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $44 million. As many of you know, at the beginning of this fiscal year we pivoted our go-to-market resources towards organizations that have a meaningful runway to invest in enterprise automation over the long-term. This investment has significantly increased our presence in the C-suite and helped raise our profile with partners of all sizes. You could feel our momentum at Forward VI, our annual user conference, where we hosted more than 3,000 guests, including automation practitioners, industry visionaries, and key customer decision makers. We also launched our inaugural UiPath AI10 Awards program, recognizing UiPath customers who embody what it means to be a leader in AI at Work. I left the event super energized about the tangible value our platform is delivering for customers and our leadership position in the market. FX-adjusted dollar based net retention for the quarter was 123% and we closed a record number of third quarter deals over $1 million in ARR. Customers with $1 million or more in ARR grew 31% to 264, while customers with $100,000 or more in ARR increased to 1,974. Industry verticalization continues to be a strategic priority for the company with playbooks, marketing events and enablement to support our teams. We now have 70 solution accelerators available in our marketplace, with IT Service Management Software user provisioning and two-way match invoice processing for Coupa and SAP among some of the most popular downloads. While we saw broad based strength in net new ARR across industries this quarter, there were a couple of standouts. The Federal team delivered a record quarter as agencies are increasingly standardizing on our AI-powered Business Automation Platform with a robust set of end-to-end capabilities to enrich employee experience, create mission readiness, and achieve breakthrough outcomes. Customer highlights included Veterans Affairs, Coast Guard, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security. We are also working with the United States Department of Agriculture to support their Future of Work initiative, delivering a new era of citizen and employee experiences. Using our full platform, USDA is driving mission impactful enterprise automations across their HR, Finance, and IT departments. The program also features a digital assistant on every USDA employee desktop, driving personal productivity for approximately 100,000 employees. Momentum continues in financial services and health care where automation delivers considerable value. This includes one of our top 25 customers, a large non-profit health system in the United States. Taking a deeper look at their automation journey, they are a great example of how customers expand with us over time. Working closely with our account executives and global systems integrators, their journey started in 2018 with core RPA and, over the last several years, they have expanded to attended automation, Document Understanding, Test Suite, and Process Mining. To date, they have achieved a return on investment of over $250 million and this quarter, in one of our largest deals in company history, they expanded to the full platform as they work to create a centralized Enterprise Automation Service department with a mandate from their EVP sponsor to deliver automation across their entire enterprise. They are also in the process of developing use cases for Communications Mining and UiPath Apps. Customers standardize on our AI-powered Automation Platform to deliver transformational outcomes that streamline processes, eliminate errors, and operate with the enterprise-quality execution needed to succeed in today's environment. A great example is  Johnson Controls  (NYSE:JCI). After starting their automation journey in 2021 with core RPA, they adopted the full UiPath platform as they work to consolidate the automation program to one end-to-end solution. They also plan to leverage our AI capabilities like Document Understanding, Test Suite, and Task Mining to drive automation across their entire business. Another example is The Department for Work and Pensions, the United Kingdom's largest public service department. They have been using core RPA since 2018 to help their most vulnerable citizens improve their quality of life by automating millions of service and support claims each year. Since their first deployment, they have scaled to over 1,000 robots in production and saved 3.1 million hours to date. During the quarter they expanded to the full platform as they look to harness AI and integrate Document Understanding, Process Mining, and Communications Mining into their automation program to improve citizen services, drive operational efficiency, and increase cost saving and capacity creation. We are also landing new logos which are adopting multiple platform products in their first purchase like Tenable and KIK Consumer Products. In their first phase of deployment KIK intends to leverage unattended robots and Document Understanding to drive efficiency across their finance department, with the long-term goal of scaling automation across the entire enterprise. Our value-based go-to-market tool, NorthStar, also continues to drive deeper customer conversations as we strategically position the differentiated and actionable benefits of AI-powered automation. A great example is Sobeys, a customer since 2020, where we created a NorthStar roadmap to help them maximize the return on investment of their automation program. And as a result, Sobeys expanded the automation footprint in the quarter to streamline processes in finance, merchandising, and supply chain and to improve their hiring process in stores. They are also investigating how they may be able to use our platform in their SAP transformation journey. Turning to our SAP partnership, while in the early stages, we are excited about the collaboration between our teams. I recently joined Scott Russell, SAP Executive Board Member, Customer Success, to co-host their sales leadership meeting and we continue to see success in signing new logos from this partnership. Key one for me The Arnott’s Group, [indiscernible] in Australia, an Australian legend, the Australian producer of biscuits and snack food, The Arnott’s Group selected the UiPath Platform to optimize business processes and reduce operating costs. Their initial focus will be on automating end-to-end sales order and invoice processing. We also announced an expanded partnership with Deloitte, one of SAP's largest and most strategic partners. Deloitte will embed the UiPath AI-powered Business Automation Platform into their Ascend service delivery platform, powering the next generation of SAP transformations. These strategic relationships are powerful for our customers, but they also drive increased engagement with GSIs, and our partner ecosystem, that has never been more invested in than they are right now. At Forward VI, we hosted an impactful session for more than 750 partners outlining our streamlined strategy that is designed to accelerate growth and revenue for our partners, while creating solutions that deliver exceptional value to our customers. Our partners and GSIs are an important element of our go-to-market motion that help us expand our reach to customers in a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective way. For example, working with Deloitte, an Australian Government agency has built a robust automation program across their finance and HR business lines where they utilize Document Understanding to streamline invoice processing, reduce errors, and enhance data accuracy. To further accelerate their automation program, they adopted Task Mining in the quarter to analyze processes and accelerate scoping activities. Broadening our technology ecosystem also makes it easier for customers to deploy automations. We recently announced several new strategic partnerships. These include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Bedrock, which enables automation developers and citizen developers to seamlessly integrate Generative AI directly into their UiPath Studio and Studio Web automations, and the availability of the AI-Powered Business Automation Platform on the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Marketplace in early 2024. In summary, third quarter results are another proof point of our commitment to delivering strong top line growth with expanding profitability and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow. I want to thank our employees and partners for their support. None of this would be possible without your relentless focus on unlocking value for our customers day in and day out. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Daniel.
Daniel Dines: Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon everyone, thanks for joining us. The automation market is at an inflection point, and as the market leading tool that enables organizations to derive actionable value from AI, we believe this is a huge opportunity for UiPath. At Forward VI we introduced our latest platform release, 2023.10, and delivered scores of new capabilities that seamlessly translate the potential of AI into tangible action to drive business outcomes for our customers. From my perspective one of the most exciting announcements at Forward was UiPath Autopilot, a new set of AI-powered capabilities for developers, testers, analysts, and knowledge workers, designed to enhance the user experience across the UiPath platform. We expect Autopilot, which is based on Generative AI, to bring our unique capabilities in RPA, API automation, Document Understanding, and Specialized AI to the full spectrum of enterprise-grade end-to-end processes automation. Autopilot for Studio is intended to help developers across skill levels build automations faster by leveraging natural language descriptions to generate automation workflows. For less technical developers this is a great starter tool, while an advanced developer will benefit from increased productivity. Autopilot for Test will accelerate every phase of the testing lifecycle from generation of tests to surfacing insights from test results. And, finally, as the AI companion for business users, we anticipate that Autopilot for Everyone will help users create and use personalized and intelligent micro automations on the fly. We also shared exciting announcements around Intelligent Document Processing at Forward, introducing our next-generation experience powered by active learning and Generative AI. Our next-gen IDP permits almost anyone to train Specialized AI models for specific domains and document types, and our internal benchmarking shows that our next-gen IDP experience accelerates model training time by up to 80% from a week to a day for complex scenarios, or down to minutes for simpler forms. Document Understanding is driving significant value for customers including a Chicago based public utility. Working with Deloitte, they have created a robust automation program across their organization leveraging our AI products like Document Understanding to automate their meter inspection process where they have achieved over $12 million and 163,000 hours in savings to date. With c-level sponsorship, during the quarter they expanded their UiPath deployment to incorporate Test Suite into their automation journey with a goal of saving over $70 million a year. And, we are humbled by third-party recognition of our achievements, including IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Intelligent Document Processing or IDP, 2023-2024 Vendor Assessment where UiPath was named a leader in IDP for our broad market leadership and robust IDP capabilities in UiPath Document Understanding and Communications Mining integrated into our broader enterprise automation platform. Innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy and we challenge ourselves every day to deliver market leading capabilities with a customer first mindset. I spent a lot of time with our teams in both Bellevue and Romania this quarter and am energized by our cutting edge product roadmap focused on transforming enterprise automation by harnessing the next-generation of AI technologies. Together with our world-class team of engineers I am excited to dedicate more time driving UiPath's innovation agenda as I transition into my new Chief Innovation Officer role this winter. With that, I will turn it over to Ashim.
Ashim Gupta: Thank you, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis and all growth rates are year-over-year. Turning to the third quarter, ARR totaled $1.378 billion, an increase of 24%, driven by net new ARR of $70 million. Excluding the FX tailwind, net new ARR totaled $69 million. We ended the quarter with 10,865 customers, including new logos like New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), Smile Doctors, Beacon Health System, and MidWestOne Financial Group. As we said last quarter, we continue to see macro headwinds at the lower end of our market and remain focused on acquiring customers with a higher propensity to grow. Our dollar-based net retention rate for the third quarter was 121%. Normalizing for FX, dollar-based net retention rate was 123%. Dollar-based gross retention of 97% continues to be best-in-class. Revenue grew to $326 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Normalizing for FX, which was an approximately $3 million tailwind, revenue grew 23%. Remaining performance obligations increased to $995 million, up 31% year-over-year. Normalizing for FX, which was an approximately $16 million tailwind, RPO grew 29%. Current RPO increased to $599 million. Turning to expenses. We delivered a third quarter overall gross margin of 87%, and software gross margin was 92%. As the team continues to drive cost discipline, we now expect fiscal year 2024 gross margins to be approximately 86%. Third quarter operating expenses were $240 million, highlighting the leverage in our business and our commitment to expense management and operating discipline. GAAP operating loss of $56 million included $96 million of stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating income was $44 million, resulting in a third quarter non-GAAP operating margin of 13%. Third quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $44 million. As of October 31, we had $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and no debt. Under our $500 million buyback program, which we announced on September 6th, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $16.26 through October 31. Since November 1, under a 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares at an average price of $17.38 through November 28, 2023. Now, let me turn to guidance, which assumes the global macroeconomic environment continues to be variable. For the fiscal fourth quarter 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $381 million to $386 million. ARR in the range of $1.450 billion to $1.455 billion. Non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $78 million. And, we expect fourth quarter basic share count to be approximately 567 million shares. And, finally, we expect fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of more than $250 million. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with many of you during the quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to the Operator. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. [Indiscernible] on for Keith Weiss. Maybe to start off, quick question on sort of AI and how you see it fit into the current budget environment. Clearly, budget growth is still somewhat suppressed. And you're one of the few companies that’s sort of uniquely positioned between traditional automation and generative AI technologies. Where do you see customers kind of take the dollars from when they're spending on these AI technologies, whether that's within the product areas that you offer? Or more broadly, anything that's kind of coming out of your customer conversations in terms of how spend is getting reallocated that of AI?
Rob Enslin: Yes, good question. What I would say is that when customers are looking at spending with us and the AI, the AI story and AI, connection, AI to automation connection really fits well to where customers want to invest. And in many cases, the investments are coming out of the business case and business value that we produced in NorthStar and are able to show the efficiencies in how to gain so they can invest in innovation. And they see us as an innovation leader today with AI and innovation, combined with our AI powered platform. So I don't feel like it's been taken away for one group to another, I feel it's really driven by the business case, we are able to drive with C-level suite and now we focus on industry solutions. And now we've connected those to the buying cycle with customers.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful. And then a quick question on the margin side. It looks like sales and marketing expenses stepped up pretty markedly on a sequential basis. Obviously, you also do forward contracts in the quarter, but anything that you can highlight in terms of where you're investing, are you back to kind of growing your sales force more markedly and the second will continue into next year. Anything that you can share, there will be great.
Rob Enslin: I would just highlight two points. First is, we are going to continue to invest in our sales team, especially in our sales capacity, especially as we head into next year. And then the second is if you recall, we also are dealing with -- we also have the reallocation of our software expenses. So first through third quarter, you'll see sales and marketing versus G&A, a little bit lopsided, and which will be caught up in fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Murphy: Thank you so much, and I will add my congrats. So Rob, thinking back to the Analyst Day just over a year ago, you had mentioned there that every tech company, of course has shelfware and that UiPath does as well. If you think about it about a year later, do you sense that customers have worked down any excess inventory they might have had in terms of bots, maybe hitting a level where they might need to replenish and just start moving forward a bit faster as we get into next year? And then have a quick follow-up.
Rob Enslin: Yes, Mark, look as I said earlier on, companies deal with shelfware, we feel good that our platform actually helps us move customers from not only bots into the broader platform as a focus on efficiencies, this marketplace that we're dealing with today. Certainly benefits efficiencies in new business model, so we feel really good that we are able to take customers to the next level with our platform and our C level activity.
Mark Murphy: Okay. And Ashim, when we look at it arithmetically, the deceleration in ARR has been moderating, which of course is great to see. It looks like it could step down a bit, a bit closer to 20% next quarter. But is it possible to entertain the thought of holding -- kind of holding a level around 20% for a period of time? Or do you think we should kind of keep that trending down into the teens? As we've had it just -- try to be mindful of the law of large numbers and some of the some of the macro unknowns that are out there.
Ashim Gupta: Yes, I would just say, Mark, we're really pleased with our performance and the team's execution. We are focused on closing out a good year-end here. And the teams are really focused on that. And we look at our fourth quarter guidance just putting the right prudence and the right macroeconomic variability included in our guidance, and we'll update as we get closer to next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Chirag Ved: Hi, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a very strong quarter. This is Chirag on for Kirk. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that large deals landed extremely strong. Do you have any additional commentary around what you're seeing with these large deals in terms of both new logos and renewals? And how you expect this trend to continue looking ahead to next quarter and next year? Essentially, all in all, do you believe that we're close to a more stabilized macro and spending environment? Or are you still seeing some broader choppiness out there? Thank you.
Rob Enslin: Yes, I mean, we -- look, we feel really good about how our teams are adopting all the changes that we've made and how they're connecting with customers and the relationships we're having with customers. The expansion has really, in many ways driven through our growth products with all the AI communication that's happening in the market, it allows us to have meaningful conversations with customers, they see why the platform is relevant. And then we as I said, early on, we've been driving NorthStar quite a bit and showing where customers can really look at processes and tasks and understand how to drive value with the automation platform. So folks talk about digital transformation and connect, we believe that AI powered automation is really helping digital transformation with our customer base and our larger customers. And we're pretty happy with some of the net new companies that we've acquired over the last -- the quality of them, you really look at these kind of -- these are good companies that will expand with us over time if we do the right stuff. And so we feel good about that, we feel good about how our industry focuses is helping us change the game in this environment.
Chirag Ved: All right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Sills: Oh, great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around some of the departmental expansions you've seen. You talked about industries here. I think banking and public sector sounded good. But are you finding that you're seeing now with the uplift in expansion activity here with NRR, that you're getting outside of finance and accounting into IT, HR, some of these other use cases in the departments?
Rob Enslin: Yes, so I would say we have broad machine broad industry activity, with manufacturing, with retail, with fashion retail with grocery hard goods retail. As we said, we feel really positive about public sector, and public sector globally. And we also see a significant amount of activity outside of the finance offers in procurement and in IT organization. So it's much more broad based. And we feel really good about where we are focused on that.
Brad Sills: Great. And then one of the forward conference, if I could please. If you could just remind us how important that event is for lead management and moving deals through the pipeline. And how do you feel coming out of the conference this year versus years past in terms of momentum? Thank you.
Rob Enslin: Brad, I’ve only got 2 years experience. And what I would tell you, I was super excited to see the quality of customers and the quality of the event and the quality of the discussions that we had. If you look at the companies we have on stage with us and what they were doing with us, these are really transformational. If you look at the partners, partnerships with SAP and Deloitte [indiscernible] this was transformation. We spoke about 750 partners that were aligning around the channel strategy. So we feel good that we actually -- forward is actually a catalyst event to move UiPath, helped our branding, position us in the C-suite and make a difference and it certainly does help our pipeline as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Raimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Firstly, a more bigger picture question, like if you think about the different areas of strengths that you saw this quarter, like can you specifically speak a little bit about what you saw on test, Rob? Because that's what we hear from our [indiscernible] as one of the areas where especially in the SAP ecosystem, there seems to be a lot going on there and not quite sure you're getting enough credit. And then I had a follow-up for Ashim, please.
Rob Enslin: Yes, it's -- so if I look at the broader picture, you look at -- if you look at the market today, as I said early on customers are looking for ways to drive efficiencies to fund other activity. And there's not a significant amount of new business models that are driving growth. So that really helps us significantly, and obviously their [indiscernible] where SAP of focus where their transformation objectives, the [indiscernible] program, which is an ongoing program. And it's -- I believe that we've actually moved the needle significantly with SAP. With the SAP activity between the different sales organizations and we are involved in many transformation discussions with SAP and our GSA partners -- GSI partners, and we will see more that test is a key part of that, because it has an incredible value proposition which allows customers to drive not only -- not necessarily savings, but time benefits. And really automation of testing is one of the biggest challenges customers have in a big SAP environment. And we feel we do an excellent job helping customers achieve significant test results, which obviously, help mitigate any risk associated with a go live.
Raimo Lenschow: Yes, okay, perfect. Then, one for Ashim. As you think about like it does look like the demand trends are stable, and we kind of could potentially look for better times ahead. Obviously, you have the best net ARR addition for a few quarters now as well. How do you and you guys -- but also you guys have been very disciplined around cost and margins, but at some point, you need to think about lead times for sales people, et cetera. How do you think about that balance of like getting ready for eventually better times versus where you are at the moment? What are you seeing in terms of productivity gains, proceeds, et cetera, for example, to kind of drive this going forward? Thank you.
Rob Enslin: I mean, I would start with we have a very powerful business model, Raimo, strong gross margins that allows us to invest while still generate cash and margins. And so we have been investing, whether that is within our product team as well as our sales team. I mentioned earlier, we're investing in our frontline sales team and our sales capacity. And we'll continue to invest in areas where we see the right returns and the right investments. And Rob and the team looks at that on an ongoing basis, and we do as a leadership team. At the same time, we also are looking for efficiencies. So together with that I think we're constantly in investment mode we feel very positive about our value offering and we feel like we can both drive that investment while still generate cash and margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist. Please proceed with your question.
Terry Tillman: Yes, congrats from me on the quarterly results, first of all. I guess, Rob, maybe the first question is, maybe I'm pretty simple here. But NorthStar roadmaps seem like a no brainer, like how much of your customer base [indiscernible] your larger enterprises. Have you actually unleashed the NorthStar roadmaps on? And the second part of my first question is, I'm hearing a lot from you about full platform adoption. Have you done anything with product or packaging to create less inertia to move all in with the platform and then add a follow-up for Ashim.
Rob Enslin: Sure. Great questions. So I would say, we are doing a lot around pricing and packaging, and obviously pricing, packaging and solutions. And it's a constant upgrade, I would say of that. But you got to be very careful about how you actually bring that into the market. And we're focused on really simplifying SKUs and so making it very simple for customers to purchase. And also make it simple for customers to mix and match solution sets with AI units or bots in a way that's very simple, so that they can actually expand with less friction and we are doing significantly more of that. NorthStar is a combination of a great value based tool that has to be connected to the C-suite. You have to have sellers that are able to communicate and as we enable our organization more and we get more references, we are able to scale more and continue to scale the organization, so there's still plenty opportunity for us to continue driving that and continue to work on NorthStar with organizations.
Terry Tillman: That's great. Thank you for that, Rob. And I guess, Ashim, in terms of all the work on the go-to-market side this year, is there potentially a further drift in NRR? Could it actually improve from here? I mean, it's already best-in-class. I'm just kind of curious how you could see NRR trends potentially with more of the harvesting of all this work on the go-to-market side. Thank you.
Ashim Gupta: I just say we continue to be pleased with where we are and how we're executing and we're going to look forward to closing out fourth quarter and we'll provide more updates next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer. Please proceed -- with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.
Fred Havemeyer: Hey, thank you very much. And I'd also like to congratulate you on a very strong quarter. I wanted to focus once again on generative AI. But firstly, looking at your product to see it being integrated throughout your portfolio and your suite, I'm looking forward to [indiscernible] what you can do there. But I wanted to take a, I guess a bigger picture, look at the longer term outlook of the market considering some of the impressive results [indiscernible] autonomous agents using for example, like GPT, for blending vision texts, et cetera. I'm curious, considering that UiPath has recently been one of the original autonomous agent companies with your attended and unattended RPA, how do you think about the market evolution over time with [indiscernible] or agents like functionality being built using generative AI now?
Daniel Dines: Well, I think that direction in the market that we are seeing right now, around autonomous agents prove a bit -- our approach that always said that AI plus automation is the thing that drives the biggest outcomes for our customers. Actually, this is what we are seeing a lot of our customers after the initial, a little bit of a pause around how AI is going to help me with my automation, they realize that they need powerful automation platform in order to harvest the power of AI. And going forward on a longer term basis with UiPath are in one of the best positions to build the next generation foundational models that understand processes, tasks, screens and documents, the type of multimodal that is built in, in order to drive automation. So it's -- to me, it's clear that the world is going into that direction. And again, we are really in a very good position to take advantage of it.
Rob Enslin: Thank you for that. I'm looking forward to having an intern as a service to be able to help out autonomously and everything. I hope also just related to the topic here of generative AI, I’ve consistently heard feedback about the difficulty of organizing one's own data within an enterprise in a way that's useful. And so I'm curious what you're hearing from your customers about how they're beginning to and attempting to approach their own generative AI strategies and whether UiPath's automation platform is really able to help customers more holistically across the board with generative AI.
Daniel Dines: Yes, actually, this is one of the major use cases where automation is used right now in order to fine train customer [indiscernible] were even specialized AI. And it's frankly one of the hot discussion points with our partners around the world. We had interesting discussions in Japan and in the U.S with companies like Accenture (NYSE:ACN), were Deloitte that are very interested in to how they can leverage automation to cleanse the data and to accelerate custom training of [indiscernible] and specialized AI.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Siti Panigrahi: Thank you. So it's good to see this net new ARR bounce back. So are you speak with your customer? What do you think the enterprise spending train would be next year in terms of priority for automation spending?
Rob Enslin: Yes, I mean, we've done -- we've looked at different analysts, different markets and many analysts will tell you that they see cloud or [indiscernible] data and cyber and automation is the key trends in terms of spending next year. But I would caution and say, customers are, as I said early on are very thoughtful in how they want to spend, where they want to spend and where -- how they're going to fund it, which benefits us and benefits us in the way that we actually approach customers. I don't see a significant change in that spending. I do think that customers are going to look to see how AI and AI automation and Gen AI can help them drive more efficiency and deeper levels of efficiency in the organization and look at different models when it comes to customers and our customers, how they communicate with customers, how they drive customer journeys as well. And we are focused on helping our customers with that approach in a deep way. Also connecting meaningful inputs and outputs in companies around documents and social communication emails into this process in order to drive real process orchestration at a different level.
Siti Panigrahi: Thank you. And, Ashim, a follow-up. If I capture your total customer count, it seems like it does come down this quarter. But you guys also had a pretty good -- on your enterprise segment spending. So wondering like, was there anything different you saw in different segments, like small versus mid to large segment?
Ashim Gupta: Yes, look, we're very pleased with how our enterprise segment is performing. The macroeconomic variability that we've talked about has had more pronounced impact on the lower end of the market with smaller businesses. And that's where we see the majority of our churned customers, which Rob mentioned also earlier. Overall, I think our strategy remains consistent. We're focused on the quality of customers. And we define quality as customers with a high propensity to buy and we liked the way the teams are executing against that strategy.
Siti Panigrahi: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Turits: Hey, guys, congrats on solid execution. So two questions. One, where are we in terms of the shortening of the deployment time for the average bot? It seems like it has already improved and does the rollout of autopilot help shorten that time even further? And then have a follow-up for Ashim on [indiscernible]. Thanks.
Daniel Dines: This is always one of our major product focus on how can we shorten the adoption curve for our customers. And we are already seeing with our autopilot family that is in private preview some really good results with the initial set of few hundreds of customers that are testing the product. So, yes, I would say that this is going to be a significant driver for adoption. And both for advanced developers, where they will get to really increase the productivity to also citizen developers that will get started faster. And also, I would like to mention that training our specialized Document Understanding and Communication Mining models using Gen AI, it has already proven this is actually in production already. And it's been proven to accelerate the deployment quite a bit.
Michael Turits: Thanks, Daniel. And then, Ashim, on the NRR, it's great to see it having stabilized on an as reported basis. But could you go down another two points, as it did last quarter on an FX adjusted basis. So what are the puts and takes there? You're actually getting slightly easier comps. So what -- what's pulling that down at this point? And what are the things that are working in trying to actually increase in NRR?
Rob Enslin: Yes, I mean, I look at our dollar base net retention adjusted for FX, it's 123%, which in our scale we're very pleased with and continues to be in the best-in-class territory. There always be a little bit of large numbers. And of course, every quarter's deal mix will change. But overall, we're really pleased with the strategy. I think we've had several marquee deals in the quarter. The penetration and the sale of the platform as Rob mentioned, we're making -- we continue to make really good progress on and we see very good strong performance in the enterprise segment, particularly in North America. A lot of the -- whatever headwinds we do see, we see really pronounced in the more pronounced in the lower end of the market. But overall our strategy is on customers with a higher propensity to buy. We feel like we are executing against that strategy and we're seeing that results in the deal quality and the customer quality though -- the end -- the customer quality in the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Berg: Hi, everyone. Nice quarter here. Thanks for taking my questions. Your net new ARR was up year-over-year for the first time, I believe since fourth quarter fiscal '22. So nice change there on the positive side. I think most of the questions have been on your execution within the quarter and have a commentary from the demand end of the market. Are you seeing any changes around your customers or the environment more mid market enterprise? Because you mentioned the down market a couple different times in the macro impact there. But are you seeing any sort of positive change upward in demand from whether it's existing customers or [indiscernible]?
Rob Enslin: Yes, I mean, I do definitely see positive demand, positive conversations in the market. We feel like we have a significant seat at the table with the AI, open AI, chat GBT kind of discussion that's been taking place. And plus, having the platform has allowed us to have C level, sea level conversations. We have customers now that are really calling us to actually have discussions with. They've been using Core RPA since 2018, 2019 and they feel like there's an opportunity to expand it. They're not getting hold of that. They're not getting as much value as they believe they could get out of it. And those conversations are taking place. And we're able to actually showcase proof points on how to do this. So that -- yes, definitely more positive and definitely feel good about the discussion of how we can help customers and how we are more relevant to the business discussion.
Scott Berg: Got it. Helpful. And then, Ashim, your current RPO metrics growth rate accelerated pretty meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. Was there any one-time anomalies? I don't know, early renewals or something that impacted that abnormally in the quarter? Was that a pretty clean calculation metric? Thank you.
Ashim Gupta: No, major abnormalities like early renewals, et cetera. I think I've mentioned we had several marquee deals in the quarter and record number of deals above a $1 million for the third quarter. So it's just its execution and really good deal quality that's driving that metric.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Turrin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two part, I'll just ask up front. Rob, given investments you mentioned in reaching the C-suite, wondering if you can provide us with your perspective around how enterprise customers are approaching IT budget growth into next year and automation as a part of that. And then, as a second part for, Ashim, can you comment on the visibility you have into 4Q forecast currently and any swing factors for us to consider in terms of potential upside there? Thank you.
Rob Enslin: Yes, Michael, I'll take it now, let Ashim go later. Because we are having these conversations in the boardroom, customer -- customer conversations much wide to C level suite. We are much earlier in the budget cycles than we previously been. And we are actually much more important in the budget cycle than I believe we've been previously. I think there's a couple of really key points that stand out right our industry. How we've driven industry and how we made ourselves relevant in particular industries and the value proposition there. I do believe that the global systems integrators and how they've come along and support of us, the messaging around SAP has driven while and the platform proof points around, DEU and announced the customer that are $250 million savings in my earning script. This is what's really allowing us to participate. And so we feel like we are meaningful part of where the budgets are going next year. I think everybody is looking at how tight their budgets are, and trying to find out how to move from one pocket to another pocket on the innovation side. And we are definitely on the innovation side of customers thinking and then I'll hand it over to Ashim.
Ashim Gupta: Yes, so just in terms of our guidance, we've factored in the macroeconomic variability that we've talked about, and it includes the current view of our deal mix. And we look at just executing -- the teams are focused on executing a good end to year-end, close to the year, and that's what we're focused on. That's what I've [indiscernible] on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Jared Levine: Thanks. It's actually Jared on for Bryan today. In terms of the competitive environment any changes from what you're seeing from Microsoft ServiceNow or Automation Anywhere?
Rob Enslin: Yes. I have a look at -- if I look at ServiceNow, we don't see them in many opportunities. What I will tell you, our service, our connectors, the one of the most, it is the most popular downloaded connected to UiPath and we continue to partner with them. And our partnership with Microsoft around co-pilot and [indiscernible] pilot, the discussions we're having with them continues to be robust. And we are very happy with where we going with Microsoft, and that partnership. And as for a lot of the traditional RPA vendors, I feel that we are now -- we've broadened our skill sets and what we are offering we don't see them that often anymore.
Jared Levine: And then do you have any data points on how the new bundled pricing packages is increasing revenue, uplift per client or anything around revenue uplift from the reduction of SKUs as part of the sales refresh?
Rob Enslin: I don’t have specific that we can point to now. I mean, we are looking at the results is probably a little bit too early for us to kind of come out with where we are on that. But we do feel good that early signs of, I would just simply say, easier for customers to understand, easier for them to move. Definitely -- they definitely like how they're able to use AI units across multiple products and interchange them as they think of new use cases to advance their business as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Ethan Bruck: Hey, guys, this is Ethan Bruck on for Alex Zukin and thanks for taking question and congrats on the nice results. I guess, Rob, this one might be for you. If we were to like unpack a little bit and like more color, there's some stuff you saw in the quarter in terms of just either like certain verticals where we saw -- I know you mentioned on like the variable demand, but just kind of comparing from the macro, maybe by vertical basis, if something's got improved, or were more steady versus the last few quarters you've seen, and then just a bit on renewal behavior in terms of what it's like more -- buying more licenses, more [indiscernible] just kind of how was the kind of renewal conversation in 3Q compared to what you saw at the beginning of the year?
Rob Enslin: Yes. Look, the last quarter was a very strong quarter for public sector for our federal business actually in the U.K., and in the United States. And that was really because the Federal businesses are looking at the platform in a unique way, and we offer some really incredible capabilities around Document Understanding, connecting that to attended automation, focusing on how citizens can improve their [indiscernible]. So we've seen us our -- our market move in public sector, that also is based on talent, the talent we bought into that environment and how we've driven that talent. And now we actually have some really good industry-based activity in public sector, in revenue services, in DoD, in customs, in USDA, that actually can really help all of our public sector activity globally. When you look at traditional markets, like when you look at traditional -- more traditional markets, telcos, CPG companies, manufacturing, retail companies, they're all driving efficiencies and driving efficiencies in retail, it's how fast can open up stores? How fast can I get employees on? How do I make [indiscernible] my price points are valid, and my price points are real, and I don't have any price point issues between stores and so on. And actually automation really drives some significantly capabilities in that we play a significant role. If you look at capital intensive telcos, it's all about efficiencies, and how can I get competitive advantage efficiencies because my markets are mature. And the only way I actually get growth is by competing my competition and moving subscribers from one provider to another provider. And in that space, we're playing pretty well. So it's variable in which industries you're in, it's variable in terms of how they see growth and where they are investing. But there's one common theme across the board and that's efficiencies. With renewals, it gives us an opportunity to drive a platform, to drive the platform earlier, to actually start having the discussions with customers most -- many months or many quarters earlier in terms of why move to the platform. Here's the value. Let's work on NorthStar with you. Let's get in the office. We've got an SAP transformation. We can help you with that as well. Let us bring one of our big global [indiscernible] showcase the transformation. And that really helps drive a different cadence with renewals. It's not just about renewing what you've already got, it's about renewing what you want to do in the future and how you want to add more business value in the future. And I think we're incredibly good at that right now.
Ethan Bruck: That's super clear. And then just, Ashim, as a quick one for you, the incremental margins in the quarter, they're really good. They've been really good all year. I guess just, if you remind us just some of the puts and takes we should keep in mind around how to think about the margin profile kind of the in the out years? Thanks again.
Ashim Gupta: Look, we -- I would refer you back to our Investor Day pitch [ph] last year, where we talked about long-term operating -- just our long-term operating model there. We're really pleased with the execution on the margin front. We've been ahead of that curve in terms of just execution. And we feel really good about our ability to operate with discipline and efficiency while still investing in growth for the company.
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Rob Enslin: Yes, I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you to all of you for all the support. It's great to have you all on the call today. Happy holidays to you and your family. May you enjoy a great time. [Indiscernible].
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Robert Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen, and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline our discussion topics this morning. I will begin by covering the current retail environment and how the strength of Kroger's value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then, Gary will cover our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons, before we open it up for questions. Now, turning to our third quarter. Kroger's third quarter results highlight the strength and diversity of our business model in a challenged operating environment. A strong fuel performance and growth in our alternative profit businesses supported continued adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth. As consumer spending tightens, we are focused on providing customers with exceptional value by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, personalized promotions and rewards. We are growing households and increasing loyalty, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Customers are managing many economic factors that are pressuring their spending, including higher interest rates, reduced savings, and fewer government benefits, including SNAP. Although inflation is decelerating, customers are still adjusting to the impacts from eight consecutive quarters of broad and significant inflation. During the quarter, Kroger grew higher income households once again as our attractive mix of quality, value and convenience continues to drive engagement. By buying larger packs, more fresh items and more premium Our Brands products, these households are more profitable. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are actively looking for value, and our budget-conscious customers are under more significant spending pressure. We are also looking for ways to support customers with additional value, including in-store displays with everyday staples at low price points. We've seen a great response from all customers to these offers. But engagement from our budget-conscious households has been especially strong. Customers purchasing these offer items are making more trips and buying more units, not only recognizing the value with these displays, but the value across the entire store. To help more customers manage their budget, we are only deepening our commitment to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Our personalized promotions are an increasingly critical way for customers to save on items that matter most to them. We are applying analytics to Kroger's unmatched purchase data to strike the right balance between the depth and breadth of promotions. To ensure customers were able to enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, for example, we created a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person, which represents a lower price than last year. We have a long history of delivering value to our customers by providing a broad assortment of fresh foods at low prices through our unique omnichannel shopping experience. We achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of total household growth and increased loyal households even faster, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Now, I'll provide more details about how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. Starting with seamless. [Technical Difficulty] Our digital business delivered a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses. Multiple tailwinds are driving our sales momentum, including growth in both households and visits. Our new two-hour pickup service available in more than one-third of our stores also contributed to our success in the quarter. To become the online food retailer of choice, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment. Our teams improved key customer experience metrics in pickup, increasing fill rates and reducing wait times during the quarter. This resulted in an improved net promoter scores. Our customer fulfillment centers again led our delivery growth, where we continue to rapidly increase households. Our delivery customers enjoy the convenience of on-time refrigerated delivery directly to their doorstep with zero compromise on freshness, quality, and value. Turning to personalization. Investments in our personalized capabilities ensure we are meeting elevated customer demand for savings and enables us to deploy promotional dollars more effectively. Digital offers have increased compared to last year and our personalization capabilities have resulted in even more significant increase in redemptions, driving loyalty and increasing digitally-engaged households this quarter by 13%. Digitally-engaged households are incredibly valuable to our model as they are more loyal, spend nearly 3 times more with us, and accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. Now, I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model supported earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Growth in alternative profit businesses remained strong in the third quarter with balanced growth across the portfolio. The strength of our seamless ecosystem and elevated digital engagement is having a flywheel effect, creating the traffic and the data needed to drive growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, a higher-margin profit stream. Recently, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of KPM. This quarter, KPM made an important step in its journey to become the most trusted and transparent media company. By activating ad buying platforms, we are offering more self-service solutions to meet clients where they are today, providing advertisers more direct access to custom Kroger audiences. This first iteration has already launched, and KPM expects to expand to other buying platforms in the future. These new innovative features will help accelerate KPM's impressive growth by allowing advertisers to reduce waste and enhance measurement tools. Kroger Health had a strong quarter that exceeded our internal expectations and helped drive sales and profit growth. Our decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our customers and shareholders. Our teams have done an excellent job retaining patients and utilizing our pharmacists' extra capacity to devote more time to patient care, including growing our number of vaccinations. Gary will provide more on the financial impact of this later. During the quarter, we continued to see rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs in our retail pharmacies. While the long-term impacts of these drugs on customer buying habits are unknown, Kroger's 'Food as Medicine' philosophy positions us well to support our customers' health and wellness goals. Our comprehensive approach includes healthcare services, professional dietitians, and proprietary tools like our nutrition rating app, OptUP, which are all designed to support healthy living and to do so holistically. While we pride ourselves on data and insights, the patient data in our pharmacy operations is separate from our customer loyalty data and is protected by privacy laws. We are committed to using our data in an appropriate manner while not jeopardizing customers' trust. For now, we have not seen any major macro shifts in customer eating habits or spending behaviors. Food trends are constantly evolving, and we are committed to offering products that meet our customers' needs. For customers looking to adopt healthier habits with or without the help of these drugs, we are well-positioned to provide important healthcare services and healthy food options. At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, and I'm so impressed by the many ways our associates bring this to life every day in the ways they support our customers and each other. We know when associates are connected to our purpose, they feel connected to Kroger. Our annual Kroger Wellness Festival is just one example of living our purpose. This festival is one of the nation's largest health and wellness events, showcasing more than a 150 experiences and food offerings. Sponsors and celebrities joined Kroger in hundreds of thousands of visitors to share our vision for better physical, mental, and emotional health for families. It was wonderful to see the level of support and participation in this important mission. Also this quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which highlighted Kroger's significant progress on our 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' journey to expand access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food, and to reduce waste, especially food waste, across our footprint. Since we launched 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' in 2017, Kroger has donated more than 3 billion meals to feed hungry families, including more than 1.3 billion to fight food insecurity and nearly 600 million pounds of surplus food to our food bank partners. I am so proud of our teams and their efforts to reach these incredible milestones. Our associates are the driving force behind our success by delivering an outstanding customer experience and helping make the holidays even more special for our customers. We facilitate this through our long-standing commitment to invest in associate wages and benefits and training tools to advance their career growth. Feed Your Future, our continuing education benefit, is one of the important ways we make Kroger a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. This benefit provides up to $21,000 lifeline, and it's helped almost 6,000 associates this year alone, with approximately 90% of these participants being hourly. Our focus on development is contributing to strong improvements in retention, which includes associate continuity and a more consistent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are allowing Kroger to navigate a challenged environment, characterized by tightening consumer spending and food-at-home disinflation. We achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% this quarter, while also providing greater value for our customers, higher wages for our associates, and investing in strategic initiatives that will support future growth. This was made possible by our teams delivering strong performances across our margin expansion initiatives, fuel, alternative profit businesses, and health and wellness. Our year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023, building on record results over the prior three years. I'll now provide more detail on our third quarter. Identical sales without fuel decreased 0.6%. Underlying growth would have been positive 1% adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first two quarters of the year, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel and a negative effect on the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall net effect on operating profit was slightly positive. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle the impact of Express Scripts at the start of the new calendar year. Turning back to identical sales without fuel. As Rodney shared earlier, our seamless ecosystem is a critical component of our growth strategy, building customer loyalty and fueling our alternative profit businesses. Digital sales were a highlight in the quarter, growing 11%. Our overall sales continue to be affected by industry-wide disinflation. Inflation ended quarter three in the low-single digits, approximately 270 basis points lower than the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw inflation decline at a slower pace, and we would expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining positive at the year-end. Encouragingly, units have shown signs of improvement as inflation has decelerated, and we have sequentially improved units for four straight quarters. However, unit growth rates have lagged the rate of inflation decline and have not improved at the pace we would have expected. As a team, we are laser-focused on returning to unit growth and expect improvement in volumes to continue for the balance of the year. Gross margin was 22% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel increased 3 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we increased investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, and we were able to successfully fund these investments by continuing to execute our long-term margin improvement plan, including Our Brands optimization, sourcing efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Shrink was a headwind to gross margin during the quarter, primarily due to the continued rise in industry-wide theft and organized retail crime. We are investing in initiatives to mitigate shrink and protect our associates and customers in our stores. Looking ahead, we would expect these same factors that influence gross margin in quarter three will drive a similar outcome for gross margin rate in the fourth quarter. During quarter three, we recorded a LIFO charge of $29 million compared to a charge of $152 million for the same quarter last year. This reduction was due to inflation returning to low-single digits compared to double-digit growth experienced last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 32 basis points excluding fuel and adjustment items. The increase in OG&A rate was driven by planned investments in associate wages and benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. During the quarter, we also made the decision to invest in a number of strategic initiatives that are expected to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Investments were partially offset by execution of cost saving initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. We are confident in our ability to effectively manage costs and continue to deliver savings by eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience. We continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities across the business and remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. In the fourth quarter, we would expect our OG&A rate to be relatively flat compared to last year. Kroger Health is an important component of our value creation model and is delivering profitable growth in 2023. During the quarter, the team exceeded our internal goal for the number of vaccinations administered, and the higher profit margins associated with these vaccines helped offset the negative impact on margin rate from growth in GLP-1 drugs. As Rodney shared earlier, we are excited about the momentum in health and wellness, and see significant potential for future profitable growth in this area of our business. Fuel is also a key part of our strategy and through our rewards program is another way that we deliver value for customers and increase loyalty. Our fuel team did an outstanding job delivering results that were ahead of expectations in the third quarter. Our customers saved 14% more in rewards per fuel purchase compared to last year, which led to gallon sales outpacing the industry. The average retail price of fuel was $3.77 this quarter versus $3.84 last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.57 this quarter versus $0.50 last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. Kroger has made substantial investments over the last five years in our associates, raising the average hourly wage by more than 33%. We remain committed to supporting our associates with sustainable investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that will, at the same time, allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities that we serve. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drug, Dallas Meat and four stores in Roundy's, in total covering more than 19,000 associates. We have now ratified all agreements that were scheduled for negotiation in 2023. Turning to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and the disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4, which remains well below our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.3 to 2.5. This positions us well to execute our financing strategy to close the proposed merger with Albertsons early in 2024 and then quickly return to within our target leverage range post-merger. As I wrap up my comments on the quarter, let me provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Today, we updated our full-year guidance to reflect the impact of near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation. We now expect full-year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1%, and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023. Our latest sales trends would put us on track to achieve the midpoint of our updated annual sales guidance range. Importantly, we would expect to exit quarter four with a stronger sales trend than our overall results for the quarter as we start to cycle the effect of Express Scripts in January. We believe we are well-positioned to navigate near-term headwinds and the strength we are seeing in our alternative profit businesses, health and wellness and fuel, combined with a lower expected LIFO charge, gives us the confidence to raise the lower-end of our full-year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance range. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 to $4.60. And looking forward, Kroger remains committed to delivering attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with  Albertsons Companies . As of November 15, 2023, Kroger certified substantial compliance with the second request issued by the FTC. We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction. This step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement, including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S is a well-qualified buyer who meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction and will ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger. Frontline (NYSE:FRO) associates will remain employed and existing collective bargaining agreements will continue. We have made a compelling case to both Kroger and Albertsons stakeholders. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for our customers by lowering prices beginning on day one, extends our commitment to associates by increasing wages and benefits, and deepens trust with our communities by keeping stores open to assure America has access to fresh and affordable food. In terms of integration planning, we are progressing well. Our integration teams have made significant progress toward our first goal, which is to ensure continuity for associates and customers at closing. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both organizations and how we'll be able to learn from each other to provide customers with an even stronger food retail experience and compete even more effectively against larger non-union operators in the future. In closing, Kroger delivered another quarter of solid results. We are demonstrating our ability to manage through a more challenged environment and remain committed to balancing our investments in our associates and in lower prices for our customers, while continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Dean Rosenblum of Bernstein. Dean, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dean Rosenblum: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Hey, my question is really about a debate regarding the gross profit and operating profit impact of increasing digital sales. I mean, online was -- digital sales were up 11% this quarter on a total comp, ex Express Scripts of 1%, which says it's growing share. Can you help us understand -- I know you think about it in terms of the whole digital ecosystem, including the alternative revenues. But in terms of the actual operating profit contribution from digital relative to the stores, can you help us understand how to think about that as that mix continues to increase?
Rodney McMullen: If you look currently, digital would not be as profitable as stores. We do believe over time, that will change, and we think that'll change by multiple things, the overall ecosystem. If you look at the pickup, we continue to make significant progress on reducing the cost to serve a customer on pickup. If you look at our sheds, we continue to make progress on our sheds to get them to where the profitability of the shed would be the same as the store. So, if you just step back, kind of, we view job one is make sure we don't lose the customer. And what we find is that customer over time will spend more with us when they're engaged with us through pickup, delivery, and in-store. And then, obviously, if you look at the incremental profitability that is making meaningful progress, and we also, when you include media as well, that's making progress. So, if you look initially, it is not as profitable, but we have every expectations over time that it will be.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, Rodney, maybe just to add, Dean, a couple of specific data points. Can you hear me okay?
Dean Rosenblum: Yeah, please.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Dean, I think we talked, Dean, before about, we sort of bucket our digital business into two areas, the sort of the business prior to launching our CFCs, which will be pickup and delivery through our third-party providers, and then our customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado (LON:OCDO). We've talked before about the pickup and delivery business sort of having a pass-through profitability rate on incremental sales of around 5% or mid-single-digit percent and the store being sort of north of 15%. And we talked a couple of years ago about being on a journey to improving that pass-through rate through some of the things that Rodney mentioned around improving mix, around improving media revenue per transaction, and then also lowering the cost to fill a digital order. We've made good progress on all three of those areas, and we would certainly see now sort of the digital pass-through profitability heading towards that double-digit rate sort of on that journey towards getting towards parity in terms of overall profitability. And then, the Ocado CFCs, we're really still very much in the early stages of that journey where the total investment is sort of starting to peak and we're starting to see tailwinds in that profitability as we start to achieve more scale in those facilities.
Dean Rosenblum: That's great. Thanks so much, Gary. My follow-up question is, you mentioned certifying the second request substantial completion on November 15th. That would suggest that the FTC now has 30 days to either make a decision or to extend the period. Do you have any sense right now as to whether we might expect some sort of an FTC decision or that the FTC is more likely to extend the time for that decision?
Rodney McMullen: Dean, it's a great question. And if you look as you -- in our prepared comments, we expect to close in early 2024 as we have all along. We continue to have a cooperative relationship with the FTC and other interested parties, and it's still too early in terms of specific dates. Thanks, Dean.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Kessler: Hi there. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks, guys. Maybe starting with the question on your inflation or deflation outlook for 2024, what your current expectation is? And what would need to happen in the backdrop for us to see either deflation or a return to more modest inflation? And in the event that we see deflation, is there a scenario in which you can hold or still expand margins, even in that kind of backdrop?
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, thanks for the question. As you know, we'll certainly provide a lot more specific details of our outlook for 2024 when we get to our quarter four earnings in March. And we're continuing, as I'm sure many are in the market, to look at all the data points we see both internally and externally. We're probably looking at some of the same data sources that you are from the top likes of USDA and other published sources. I think our view right now, we recognize we don't have the perfect crystal ball and we'll continue to watch and evaluate how we see the outlook for next year. But overall, most of the data that we're seeing would tend to point towards more of a typical year next year for food-at-home with food-at-home inflation being in the low single-digit range. We certainly think there are different scenarios that can play out. And of course, we'll look to adapt our model as we would need to, if those were the case, but that would be the data that we're watching. And we'll certainly provide more color when we get to the March earnings and talk specifically about our 2024 views.
Rodney McMullen: And one of the things that Gary always reminds me of, if you look over the last 50 years, there's only been two years out of the last 50 where it's been negative, where there's been actual deflation in a year. And as you know, we've been able to maintain and create strong business results in all environments, whether it's inflationary or deflationary, and you just manage accordingly.
Michael Kessler: Okay, great. And then, a quick follow-up on the fuel business, which had higher-than-expected profitability. So, can you talk about what drove that? And is there any interplay, I guess, between that business and the core supermarket business, if there's any balancing of the profitability dynamics and what you're able to earn to kind of manage the P&L? Or this is being managed separately and it just happened to come in a little stronger in Q3? Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, Gary mentioned it, but we're super proud of our fuel team and the partnership with all the divisions. We had a significant increase in the amount of fuel rewards that were issued, so we really look at leveraging both of the businesses to support each other. The other thing that the fuel team has done a nice job on is making sure from an efficiency standpoint on deliveries, on procurement and all the ingredients as well. So really proud of what they've done, but it really is we leverage both sides of the business to support each other and feel really good about where that business turned out. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Montani: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on two fronts. One was just if you could discuss the overall competitive backdrop? And then, secondly, we've heard a fair amount of promotions could uptick into next year. And I guess the question on that would be, what do you see in terms of vendor support versus you all having to fund that yourselves? And then, the follow-up was just OG&A dollar growth. Is there still potential for $1 billion cost-out into '24? And what kind of dollar growth should we look for underlying in the fourth quarter?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I'll answer the competitive backdrop and promotions, and if Gary wants to add anything, he can. And then, I'll let Gary ask about -- or answer the OG&A. If you look at overall, from a competitive standpoint, the market feels very similar than what it has been for a long time. If you look at the promotional activity, CPGs are increasing their funding on promotional. And I think there's two things driving that. One is CPG is not being satisfied with their tonnage so they're increasing the amount of support. The other thing for everyone is the supply chain constraints that would have been in place a year ago and two years ago is real getting back to normal. So, people are beginning to feel comfortable on promoting again, where the worst thing that could have happened is for us or for a CPG to promote something and then not have adequate supply. So, it really is behaviors getting back to pre-COVID. And even if you look at shopping during Thanksgiving, it was really more last minute, which really reflected, if you go back and look at pre COVID, it's kind of what it was, and people getting comfortable there will be products there when they go to buy it. So both great questions, but that's really what we're seeing right now. And Gary, on the OG&A.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Rodney. So, in OG&A, I'll just maybe take a step back as well and just mention a couple of points that I talked about in the third quarter. As we looked at the third quarter going into it, we would have expected OG&A to be a little bit lower as a rate. The things that were in the plan would have been the investments in average hourly rates and increasing wages for our associates in our stores and supply chain network and also the impact of ESI, and they were very much in line with what we expected. The real differences in the third quarter were that we did make some decisions during the quarter to make some strategic investments that we believe will help set up 2024 and beyond in terms of continued revenue growth, but also additional cost savings. So, as we look at the fourth quarter, we actually believe that the trends in average hourly rate will continue, and of course, Express Scripts will continue to be a factor. But outside of that, we'd expect OG&A to be relatively flat during the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still see both a sort of tailwind from initiatives that we've launched this year that will have a run rate benefit into next year. And we still see good line of sight to continued cost savings by leveraging technology and improving efficiency, driving continued improvement in cost to serve in digital and a number of areas of the business. So, we would remain confident that we see a good line of sight to continue to find that sort of 3% to 5% productivity improvements that we target to make sure we can continue to invest in our customers and continue to invest in our associates.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John, please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with, can you talk to -- if you think about the promotional basket, proactive versus reactive on your end, right, kind of is it -- would you say, I don't know, 80% proactive, 20% reactive? I don't know how you think about that. And then, on the reactive side, it would seem that those without a loyalty program would be at a disadvantage to you and that you can see what's going on in the market and possibly respond where yours is more stealth. Is that even remotely how you run the business, right, where you can respond to others based on what you see out there?
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, John, for the question. By far, the majority, and when I say majority would be almost all would be proactive versus reactive. Now, all our teams will check prices every single week and there'll be adjustments based on that. But by far, the majority of our discounts are proactive. And some of that is what you can see in an ad. A lot of that is the things that you've mentioned in terms of direct to individual household offers. It's one of the things that we believe the reason why our loyal households continue to grow and some of those aspects is once you become a Kroger shopper, you're getting those loyal customer mailings, which will allow you to stretch your budget more. And there's also personalized offers that you can go to look at coupons and download those, and there's significant increase in those. So, when you look at -- when you shop with us, obviously, we are a promotional merchant. But when you look at the rewards that we offer between fuel rewards and other rewards and our loyal customer mailings, our basket price overall is within less than cents of our biggest competitor. It's just we go to market and offer a little different way. But it is the reason why loyal shoppers are so important to us because that's the shopper that really gets the full value equation from us.
Gary Millerchip: Rodney, maybe the one thing I would add to John's question, too, the second part would be, I think, John, it's one of the reasons why we do have additional confidence in how we can navigate through the environment is that I think as a combination of our reward program and more customers engaging digitally post COVID, it really does create the ability to channel the dollars in a way that give the customer the most impact and most value while also being able to target it rather than having to sort of peanut butter spread it across in different directions. And I think it's a different dynamic now compared to maybe five, 10 years ago in the way that we're able to personalize that value and go to market.
Rodney McMullen: You've been -- you've followed us for a long time and you would have heard us use the word cherry-pickers and really what it is trying to make sure we do is to give value to customers that are loyal to us as opposed to somebody that's just shopping a discounted item that we're not making any money on.
John Heinbockel: And then maybe as a follow-up, so it sounds like volume is slightly -- is negative, right? I don't know if it's negative 1% or a little more than that, but volume is negative. Is that fair, low single-digit? When do you think that returns to positive territory? And is that solely driven -- if you looked at the budget-conscious customers, because I know a couple of quarters ago, you broke that out. Is that negativity largely driven by that cohort?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look, volume would be slightly negative. If you look, we -- our trends have improved for four quarters in a row from a trend standpoint. That would be largely driven by the value shopper or customers on a budget. And the half full and half empty, the half empty is obviously that's being driven by that customer. Some of that's driven because of the impact from inflation. Part of it's -- or SNAP is down about 30%. The full part is the customers that are loyal, we're continuing to grow with that customer and that customer's profitability is meaningfully better than the value shopper. Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank. Krisztina, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Krisztina Katai: Hi, good morning. So Rodney, I wanted to ask you just a conceptual question on grocery sector and the level of competition, right? Because if we're thinking about it, why wouldn't the sector be more competitive as we head into 2024? The consumer remains under pressure. Some of the low end is under increased pressure. CPGs are raising their support, volumes continue to lag. So that is question one, just conceptually, why wouldn't that be the case? And secondly, how is Kroger positioned in a potentially no inflation to even deflationary backdrop relative to the base case of a normal food-at-home year of low single-digit inflation?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look at, one of the things that makes this industry a lot of fun is we always assume that the business will continue to be more competitive. And if you look at our fundamental business model over the last five years or 10 years or 15 years, every year, we assume that it's going to be more competitive. We worked really hard to identify process changes and cost reductions so that we can continue to fund wage increases and invest in lowering prices for the customer. So, when we look at 2024, and obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail early next year when we give guidance, but right now, we don't see that environment any different than what we would have felt for the last five years or 10 years or 15 years. And the positive is customers get a better value every year and they get a better experience every year. And when you look at for us, one of the things that we think is important for the customers, the customer doesn't have to compromise. So, they get amazing fresh product that will last a long time when they get at home, with amazing friendly associates, with the smile and support that everything in their basket plus a little bit an extra piece of cheese or something they've engaged with Murray, so -- and not have to compromise from a pricing standpoint. So, when you look overall, we feel very good in terms of how we're positioned with the customers that really appreciate what we offer.
Gary Millerchip: Maybe, Rodney, one thing I would just add, too, Krisztina, specific to 2024, a couple of things for Kroger that we think are helpful as we look into next year. One is, of course, that we're cycling the impact of Express Scripts when we get to January and we'll start to see that flow through in the early periods of the year. And then secondly, one of the things that we've seen, as we look at 2023, many states, as you know, reduced the amount of SNAP dollars that were available in the market, and those happened sort of around the middle part of our Q1 last year or this year, I should say. What we've seen in one or two markets where we're cycling those earlier markets where they reduced the SNAP dollars, it certainly starts to create a bit of a different trend in the growth in those markets, too. So, we do think there's, for the industry and specifically for the markets that we operate in, as you start to cycle the impact of those SNAP dollars, which perhaps had a bit more of an impact than we were originally thinking they might across the industry, that starts to create some, I think, tailwind in the industry towards next year's growth as well.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Krisztina.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Ed, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ed Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Ed Kelly: Gary, I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. I think you said that the Q4 gross margin, you expect to be flattish. If you could just confirm that. And then looking out, is the base case for '24 that, that flattish trend would continue? And then, within that context, I'm curious about shrink. And maybe just educate us a little bit on when you do your accounts, the visibility you have on where you stand in shrink, and do you believe it's peaked?
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Ed. So, the first part of the question, yes, you're essentially right that we -- I said in my prepared comments that we would expect Q4 to look very similar to Q3. The way that I sort of would break that down is that we've been equally as pleased with the progress that we've seen in the margin improvement plan initiatives that we saw in the earlier part of the year as well. So, we continue to see strong benefits from Our Brands, strong benefits from sourcing, health and wellness, of course, with Express Scripts is a tailwind this year to gross margin, and supply chain and alternative profits. All those areas continue to generate tailwinds in our gross margin rate. What we did in the third quarter is we did invest more in gross margin to balance those benefits partly in increased pricing and promotion, as Rodney mentioned earlier. And we did also increase advertising costs during the quarter as well. So, those would have been the differences quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we saw and what we would expect to continue to be a similar pattern as we think about the fourth quarter. I'd say as we look into beyond 2023, we certainly still see a lot of potential for the tailwinds that I mentioned around Our Brands sourcing, these areas where we believe that we are on a multiyear path to continue to drive improvement and drive growth. And of course, alternative profit streams continues to grow at a double-digit pace off a bigger base as well. So, I think we still have a lot of confidence in those levers. And what we're doing is making sure we're balancing the business to set ourselves up for continued sustained growth in the future. From a shrink perspective, we would still see shrink as a headwind, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I would say, it's probably somewhat less dramatic for us than maybe some of our peer group because while we have a general merchandise business that's impacted, it's less impacted than probably some of the big-box retailers, but it would still be a headwind to our gross margin rate that would have impacted the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. That headwind actually would have been less than it was in the second quarter, not dramatically, but it would have eased somewhat. So, it's still something that we have to work through and continue to offset, but we are seeing at least the trend in terms of year-over-year growth decelerate, but it would still be a headwind today because of the crime and organized retail crime factors I mentioned earlier.
Rodney McMullen: The other thing I think is important to remember is a lot of our shrink is in our fresh departments. And our fresh departments, actually, a lot of that is, you can manage it by changing processes and using technology. And our teams have done a great job actually on improving shrink in the fresh departments because of our store teams partnering with warehouse teams on processes and leveraging technology as well, and I think as a big chunk of the trend -- slight trend improvements that Gary mentioned.
Ed Kelly: Great point.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky: Rodney, could you talk a little bit about the economy's effect and inflation on your digital business, and I'm thinking particularly about customers' willingness to spend money on any delivery fees or membership fees, and also how the economy might be impacting delivery volumes and digital order volumes?
Rodney McMullen: If you look at overall -- thanks, Chuck. If you look at overall, inflation is definitely stabilizing overall. And it's -- from a customer standpoint, they appreciate the stabilization but they also know the fact that if you look at over the last two years, they've had to endure a lot of inflation. And if you look at some of the fresh departments, some of that has actually returned back to normal. But if you look at on the process side, you wouldn't see that. So, if you look at like eggs, for an example, eggs are significantly deflationary. And we'll all be happy when we get to the point where we're cycling that early next year or next year. If you look at customer behavior, it's fascinating. Customers do a lot of work to save where they want to save or feel like they need to save, so in pack size, if you look at moving to Our Brands versus some of the national brands. But if you look at membership fees and delivery fees and things like that, that business continues to grow strongly. And in fact, it was up double digits and that's what drove the 11%. I'm sure part of that, and any time I talk to a politician, I always remind them, if you look at customers on a budget, they're under a lot of strain and they're doing a lot of behavior changes. If you look at customers that are not as focused on price because inflation hasn't affected them as much, that customers' behavior is still very strong, and they're still continuing to buy big packs, continuing to buy nicer wines, Murray's Cheese, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), things like that. So, we over-index with our membership program on customers that are more mainstream and upscale, so I'm sure that's part of the reason why we're not seeing the behavior change.
Chuck Cerankosky: Okay. Thanks for that. And just real quick, you're exiting the ghost kitchen business. Any particular reason for that?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, great question. Appreciate it. We test a lot of different things, and we'll move on to the next version of it. We still think food away-from-home is a huge growth opportunity for us and we'll continue to focus on it. The ghost kitchen, the few customers that used it, loved it, but it just wasn't enough. So, it's one of those things where you move on. So thanks, Chuck.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to Kroger's digital performance, another quarter of double-digit growth. Did anything surprise you on the digital front? And just any more color in terms of what you guys are seeing delivery versus pickup?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I'll start and let Gary finish. I wouldn't call it a surprise, but it's great to see that the NPS scores, both in terms of our year-on-year from a pickup standpoint and a delivery standpoint is very strong. If you look at our shed delivery business, the repeat rate continues to be strong. So it really is the customers really appreciate that white-glove experience. So, I don't want to make it sound like we're surprised by it, but it's nice to see what we thought play out. Gary, I'll let you...
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, I think you said it well, Rodney. I think the only thing I would add, Rupesh, is that we've said before, we believe that digital is a growth engine for the company. And I think everything we continue to see gives us that belief it will continue to be an opportunity to drive deeper customer engagement and growth. And I mentioned in a comment earlier, but the thing we didn't talk about in the script was we are seeing continued improvement in profitability. So, it's helping profitable growth as well as we're lowering the cost to fill an order, driving more efficiency through technology and continuing to see media revenue growth. So that's the only piece I think that I would reinforce.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kenneth Goldman: Hi, thank you. I'll take a shot here on next year. I know you're not in a position to really give numbers and I wouldn't ask about that now, but you did talk about hopefully having low single-digit sort of normal inflation next year. You highlighted a healthy amount of productivity you expected or expecting. But you also mentioned that maybe your unit growth right now is a little bit disappointing, and you'll surely be lapping some challenging fuel margins that I imagine you won't assume will recur. So, I'm just trying to get a sense if you have maybe sluggish units, fuel comps are tough, to get to your earnings growth algo for next year, do you theoretically have to find other drivers that are better than their algo to offset those headwinds? I just want to kind of get a sense of how to think about at least some initial headwinds and tailwinds into next year, if that all makes sense.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. As you mentioned, we'll definitely share a lot more color, as you might expect, when we get to March. I think as we think about the model and just taking a bigger picture step back, we certainly believe that we've, over the last few years, built a more diverse ecosystem as a company. So, of course, food-at-home is an important part of -- the sort of -- it drives the flywheel. But as you know, we've been continuing to grow our fuel business, continue to grow health and wellness this year even with the impact of Express Groups, and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. So, we look at it more as a journey and we do believe that as we're building the strength in that ecosystem, it creates the -- a new way to generate value for our shareholders over time as we've talked about at previous investor meetings. I mean, I think some of the points you've raised would certainly be the areas where we'll be focusing on. I don't think it's a different strategy for Kroger. It's how do we continue to drive that flywheel as we think about taking cost out of our business so that we can invest more in customers and associates, continuing to drive traffic so we can continue to grow the alternative profit businesses. And we do think there's opportunity for margin improvement to continue beyond 2023, because of the initiatives we're driving around sourcing, supply chain, alternative profit streams, et cetera. So, I think from our perspective, certainly, if you were in a period where you weren't seeing sales growth for a sustained period of time because our model is built on sales growth, we'd have to look at our cost base and we'll look at our cost base in certain areas to be more productive. But we still believe that food-at-home is -- will normalize in the typical pattern that we see of that sort of 1% to 2% inflation over time and sort of 2% to 3% food-at-home growth. And we think our model is really well set up to be able to drive growth within that framework.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ken. The only other thing I would add to Gary's comment is if you look at our seamless business, we would expect that to continue to make progress as well, as I mentioned earlier. Thanks, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As you talk to your processed food and CPG partners, what are they telling you about their desire to further raise prices into next year, given your expectation that there could be typical inflation across the assortments that would necessitate that [indiscernible] prices go up? And this is against the backdrop where volumes continue to go down, you're providing more support. Why are they not rolling back prices to try and drive volume? And as part of that, given that you used your P&L to fund promotions a bit more in the third quarter, is that a sign that you are running into the limitation of the vendors willing to provide support for you to do these promotions? Thank you very much.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael. If you look at overall, they say in economics, all short statements are wrong. And you have CPGs that are all over the board in terms of their approach. Some CPGs are very willing to give up tonnage. And if they are, Our Brands will stay -- will be there for a customer to give them incredible value. And what we find is when a customer tries Our Brands, our repeat rate is incredibly high because of the quality and the value for the money. If you look in the quarter, in terms of funding, it was really done by CPGs and us. And as I mentioned earlier, CPGs were more aggressive in funding some of the promotions in the third quarter than the second quarter, and would expect that to continue. We are seeing more CPGs worrying about their tonnage growth, and I think that's part of what's driving that willingness, too. So, I appreciate the question, and thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Good morning, Rodney and Gary. Thanks for taking our questions.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Kelly Bania: I wanted to go back to the comment about building a more diverse ecosystem and talk a little bit more about alternative profit growth. I think there was a comment that, that is still growing double digits, which I think would mean around $150 million to $200 million in incremental year-over-year profit. But maybe just wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on that if that's the right ballpark. And how many more years can this business continue to grow at double-digit rate into the coming years?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I don't know that Gary and I will want to give the specifics for '24 on the alt profit since we're still going through the process. But we would expect alt profit to be a meaningful contributor of growth next year. And that's really driven by two things. One is our continued growth in our digital business, which is supporting our media business growth. And we think we're just getting started on that. If you look in the media world, your competitors are Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and then a lot of other players. And one of the things that we think transparency is so important in being able to give people good data is we think that is incredibly helpful relative to the Googles and Metas and others. So, we see a long-term opportunity to continue to grow the business there. And the specifics, I don't know that we want to get there either. And if you look at some of the other alternative profit businesses, some of those, we have wide variance of performance within the company. So, part of that growth is just driven by taking best-in-class within our own company and growing that as well. So, Kelly, I appreciate the question. And thanks, everyone, for all the questions. And as always, I'd like to take a few moments to share some comments with our associates listening in. To start, I'd like to say a huge thank you for all the hard work that you've done to make the holidays be so memorable for our customers and what you will do for the -- following the rest of the holiday season to make it equally as memorable for customers. As you know, food plays an important part in any celebration, and it provides an opportunity for people to connect and people that we love, especially with them and sharing special moments. If you had a chance to see our holiday film, you saw that idea come to life. And if you haven't seen our holiday film, you can go to YouTube to look at the full film. And it really does recognize that food connects us all. And whether that's honoring family traditions or creating new family ones, I've just been so inspired to see how our associates and our customers on sharing their videos and the unique ways they celebrate the holidays. As I said before, thank you for everything you do to create special memories for our customers every single day. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Robert Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen, and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline our discussion topics this morning. I will begin by covering the current retail environment and how the strength of Kroger's value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then, Gary will cover our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons, before we open it up for questions. Now, turning to our third quarter. Kroger's third quarter results highlight the strength and diversity of our business model in a challenged operating environment. A strong fuel performance and growth in our alternative profit businesses supported continued adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth. As consumer spending tightens, we are focused on providing customers with exceptional value by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, personalized promotions and rewards. We are growing households and increasing loyalty, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Customers are managing many economic factors that are pressuring their spending, including higher interest rates, reduced savings, and fewer government benefits, including SNAP. Although inflation is decelerating, customers are still adjusting to the impacts from eight consecutive quarters of broad and significant inflation. During the quarter, Kroger grew higher income households once again as our attractive mix of quality, value and convenience continues to drive engagement. By buying larger packs, more fresh items and more premium Our Brands products, these households are more profitable. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are actively looking for value, and our budget-conscious customers are under more significant spending pressure. We are also looking for ways to support customers with additional value, including in-store displays with everyday staples at low price points. We've seen a great response from all customers to these offers. But engagement from our budget-conscious households has been especially strong. Customers purchasing these offer items are making more trips and buying more units, not only recognizing the value with these displays, but the value across the entire store. To help more customers manage their budget, we are only deepening our commitment to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Our personalized promotions are an increasingly critical way for customers to save on items that matter most to them. We are applying analytics to Kroger's unmatched purchase data to strike the right balance between the depth and breadth of promotions. To ensure customers were able to enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, for example, we created a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person, which represents a lower price than last year. We have a long history of delivering value to our customers by providing a broad assortment of fresh foods at low prices through our unique omnichannel shopping experience. We achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of total household growth and increased loyal households even faster, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Now, I'll provide more details about how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. Starting with seamless. [Technical Difficulty] Our digital business delivered a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses. Multiple tailwinds are driving our sales momentum, including growth in both households and visits. Our new two-hour pickup service available in more than one-third of our stores also contributed to our success in the quarter. To become the online food retailer of choice, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment. Our teams improved key customer experience metrics in pickup, increasing fill rates and reducing wait times during the quarter. This resulted in an improved net promoter scores. Our customer fulfillment centers again led our delivery growth, where we continue to rapidly increase households. Our delivery customers enjoy the convenience of on-time refrigerated delivery directly to their doorstep with zero compromise on freshness, quality, and value. Turning to personalization. Investments in our personalized capabilities ensure we are meeting elevated customer demand for savings and enables us to deploy promotional dollars more effectively. Digital offers have increased compared to last year and our personalization capabilities have resulted in even more significant increase in redemptions, driving loyalty and increasing digitally-engaged households this quarter by 13%. Digitally-engaged households are incredibly valuable to our model as they are more loyal, spend nearly 3 times more with us, and accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. Now, I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model supported earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Growth in alternative profit businesses remained strong in the third quarter with balanced growth across the portfolio. The strength of our seamless ecosystem and elevated digital engagement is having a flywheel effect, creating the traffic and the data needed to drive growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, a higher-margin profit stream. Recently, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of KPM. This quarter, KPM made an important step in its journey to become the most trusted and transparent media company. By activating ad buying platforms, we are offering more self-service solutions to meet clients where they are today, providing advertisers more direct access to custom Kroger audiences. This first iteration has already launched, and KPM expects to expand to other buying platforms in the future. These new innovative features will help accelerate KPM's impressive growth by allowing advertisers to reduce waste and enhance measurement tools. Kroger Health had a strong quarter that exceeded our internal expectations and helped drive sales and profit growth. Our decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our customers and shareholders. Our teams have done an excellent job retaining patients and utilizing our pharmacists' extra capacity to devote more time to patient care, including growing our number of vaccinations. Gary will provide more on the financial impact of this later. During the quarter, we continued to see rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs in our retail pharmacies. While the long-term impacts of these drugs on customer buying habits are unknown, Kroger's 'Food as Medicine' philosophy positions us well to support our customers' health and wellness goals. Our comprehensive approach includes healthcare services, professional dietitians, and proprietary tools like our nutrition rating app, OptUP, which are all designed to support healthy living and to do so holistically. While we pride ourselves on data and insights, the patient data in our pharmacy operations is separate from our customer loyalty data and is protected by privacy laws. We are committed to using our data in an appropriate manner while not jeopardizing customers' trust. For now, we have not seen any major macro shifts in customer eating habits or spending behaviors. Food trends are constantly evolving, and we are committed to offering products that meet our customers' needs. For customers looking to adopt healthier habits with or without the help of these drugs, we are well-positioned to provide important healthcare services and healthy food options. At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, and I'm so impressed by the many ways our associates bring this to life every day in the ways they support our customers and each other. We know when associates are connected to our purpose, they feel connected to Kroger. Our annual Kroger Wellness Festival is just one example of living our purpose. This festival is one of the nation's largest health and wellness events, showcasing more than a 150 experiences and food offerings. Sponsors and celebrities joined Kroger in hundreds of thousands of visitors to share our vision for better physical, mental, and emotional health for families. It was wonderful to see the level of support and participation in this important mission. Also this quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which highlighted Kroger's significant progress on our 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' journey to expand access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food, and to reduce waste, especially food waste, across our footprint. Since we launched 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' in 2017, Kroger has donated more than 3 billion meals to feed hungry families, including more than 1.3 billion to fight food insecurity and nearly 600 million pounds of surplus food to our food bank partners. I am so proud of our teams and their efforts to reach these incredible milestones. Our associates are the driving force behind our success by delivering an outstanding customer experience and helping make the holidays even more special for our customers. We facilitate this through our long-standing commitment to invest in associate wages and benefits and training tools to advance their career growth. Feed Your Future, our continuing education benefit, is one of the important ways we make Kroger a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. This benefit provides up to $21,000 lifeline, and it's helped almost 6,000 associates this year alone, with approximately 90% of these participants being hourly. Our focus on development is contributing to strong improvements in retention, which includes associate continuity and a more consistent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are allowing Kroger to navigate a challenged environment, characterized by tightening consumer spending and food-at-home disinflation. We achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% this quarter, while also providing greater value for our customers, higher wages for our associates, and investing in strategic initiatives that will support future growth. This was made possible by our teams delivering strong performances across our margin expansion initiatives, fuel, alternative profit businesses, and health and wellness. Our year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023, building on record results over the prior three years. I'll now provide more detail on our third quarter. Identical sales without fuel decreased 0.6%. Underlying growth would have been positive 1% adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first two quarters of the year, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel and a negative effect on the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall net effect on operating profit was slightly positive. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle the impact of Express Scripts at the start of the new calendar year. Turning back to identical sales without fuel. As Rodney shared earlier, our seamless ecosystem is a critical component of our growth strategy, building customer loyalty and fueling our alternative profit businesses. Digital sales were a highlight in the quarter, growing 11%. Our overall sales continue to be affected by industry-wide disinflation. Inflation ended quarter three in the low-single digits, approximately 270 basis points lower than the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw inflation decline at a slower pace, and we would expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining positive at the year-end. Encouragingly, units have shown signs of improvement as inflation has decelerated, and we have sequentially improved units for four straight quarters. However, unit growth rates have lagged the rate of inflation decline and have not improved at the pace we would have expected. As a team, we are laser-focused on returning to unit growth and expect improvement in volumes to continue for the balance of the year. Gross margin was 22% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel increased 3 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we increased investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, and we were able to successfully fund these investments by continuing to execute our long-term margin improvement plan, including Our Brands optimization, sourcing efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Shrink was a headwind to gross margin during the quarter, primarily due to the continued rise in industry-wide theft and organized retail crime. We are investing in initiatives to mitigate shrink and protect our associates and customers in our stores. Looking ahead, we would expect these same factors that influence gross margin in quarter three will drive a similar outcome for gross margin rate in the fourth quarter. During quarter three, we recorded a LIFO charge of $29 million compared to a charge of $152 million for the same quarter last year. This reduction was due to inflation returning to low-single digits compared to double-digit growth experienced last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 32 basis points excluding fuel and adjustment items. The increase in OG&A rate was driven by planned investments in associate wages and benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. During the quarter, we also made the decision to invest in a number of strategic initiatives that are expected to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Investments were partially offset by execution of cost saving initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. We are confident in our ability to effectively manage costs and continue to deliver savings by eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience. We continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities across the business and remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. In the fourth quarter, we would expect our OG&A rate to be relatively flat compared to last year. Kroger Health is an important component of our value creation model and is delivering profitable growth in 2023. During the quarter, the team exceeded our internal goal for the number of vaccinations administered, and the higher profit margins associated with these vaccines helped offset the negative impact on margin rate from growth in GLP-1 drugs. As Rodney shared earlier, we are excited about the momentum in health and wellness, and see significant potential for future profitable growth in this area of our business. Fuel is also a key part of our strategy and through our rewards program is another way that we deliver value for customers and increase loyalty. Our fuel team did an outstanding job delivering results that were ahead of expectations in the third quarter. Our customers saved 14% more in rewards per fuel purchase compared to last year, which led to gallon sales outpacing the industry. The average retail price of fuel was $3.77 this quarter versus $3.84 last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.57 this quarter versus $0.50 last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. Kroger has made substantial investments over the last five years in our associates, raising the average hourly wage by more than 33%. We remain committed to supporting our associates with sustainable investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that will, at the same time, allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities that we serve. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drug, Dallas Meat and four stores in Roundy's, in total covering more than 19,000 associates. We have now ratified all agreements that were scheduled for negotiation in 2023. Turning to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and the disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4, which remains well below our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.3 to 2.5. This positions us well to execute our financing strategy to close the proposed merger with Albertsons early in 2024 and then quickly return to within our target leverage range post-merger. As I wrap up my comments on the quarter, let me provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Today, we updated our full-year guidance to reflect the impact of near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation. We now expect full-year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1%, and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023. Our latest sales trends would put us on track to achieve the midpoint of our updated annual sales guidance range. Importantly, we would expect to exit quarter four with a stronger sales trend than our overall results for the quarter as we start to cycle the effect of Express Scripts in January. We believe we are well-positioned to navigate near-term headwinds and the strength we are seeing in our alternative profit businesses, health and wellness and fuel, combined with a lower expected LIFO charge, gives us the confidence to raise the lower-end of our full-year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance range. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 to $4.60. And looking forward, Kroger remains committed to delivering attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with  Albertsons Companies . As of November 15, 2023, Kroger certified substantial compliance with the second request issued by the FTC. We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction. This step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement, including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S is a well-qualified buyer who meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction and will ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger. Frontline (NYSE:FRO) associates will remain employed and existing collective bargaining agreements will continue. We have made a compelling case to both Kroger and Albertsons stakeholders. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for our customers by lowering prices beginning on day one, extends our commitment to associates by increasing wages and benefits, and deepens trust with our communities by keeping stores open to assure America has access to fresh and affordable food. In terms of integration planning, we are progressing well. Our integration teams have made significant progress toward our first goal, which is to ensure continuity for associates and customers at closing. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both organizations and how we'll be able to learn from each other to provide customers with an even stronger food retail experience and compete even more effectively against larger non-union operators in the future. In closing, Kroger delivered another quarter of solid results. We are demonstrating our ability to manage through a more challenged environment and remain committed to balancing our investments in our associates and in lower prices for our customers, while continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Dean Rosenblum of Bernstein. Dean, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dean Rosenblum: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Hey, my question is really about a debate regarding the gross profit and operating profit impact of increasing digital sales. I mean, online was -- digital sales were up 11% this quarter on a total comp, ex Express Scripts of 1%, which says it's growing share. Can you help us understand -- I know you think about it in terms of the whole digital ecosystem, including the alternative revenues. But in terms of the actual operating profit contribution from digital relative to the stores, can you help us understand how to think about that as that mix continues to increase?
Rodney McMullen: If you look currently, digital would not be as profitable as stores. We do believe over time, that will change, and we think that'll change by multiple things, the overall ecosystem. If you look at the pickup, we continue to make significant progress on reducing the cost to serve a customer on pickup. If you look at our sheds, we continue to make progress on our sheds to get them to where the profitability of the shed would be the same as the store. So, if you just step back, kind of, we view job one is make sure we don't lose the customer. And what we find is that customer over time will spend more with us when they're engaged with us through pickup, delivery, and in-store. And then, obviously, if you look at the incremental profitability that is making meaningful progress, and we also, when you include media as well, that's making progress. So, if you look initially, it is not as profitable, but we have every expectations over time that it will be.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, Rodney, maybe just to add, Dean, a couple of specific data points. Can you hear me okay?
Dean Rosenblum: Yeah, please.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Dean, I think we talked, Dean, before about, we sort of bucket our digital business into two areas, the sort of the business prior to launching our CFCs, which will be pickup and delivery through our third-party providers, and then our customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado (LON:OCDO). We've talked before about the pickup and delivery business sort of having a pass-through profitability rate on incremental sales of around 5% or mid-single-digit percent and the store being sort of north of 15%. And we talked a couple of years ago about being on a journey to improving that pass-through rate through some of the things that Rodney mentioned around improving mix, around improving media revenue per transaction, and then also lowering the cost to fill a digital order. We've made good progress on all three of those areas, and we would certainly see now sort of the digital pass-through profitability heading towards that double-digit rate sort of on that journey towards getting towards parity in terms of overall profitability. And then, the Ocado CFCs, we're really still very much in the early stages of that journey where the total investment is sort of starting to peak and we're starting to see tailwinds in that profitability as we start to achieve more scale in those facilities.
Dean Rosenblum: That's great. Thanks so much, Gary. My follow-up question is, you mentioned certifying the second request substantial completion on November 15th. That would suggest that the FTC now has 30 days to either make a decision or to extend the period. Do you have any sense right now as to whether we might expect some sort of an FTC decision or that the FTC is more likely to extend the time for that decision?
Rodney McMullen: Dean, it's a great question. And if you look as you -- in our prepared comments, we expect to close in early 2024 as we have all along. We continue to have a cooperative relationship with the FTC and other interested parties, and it's still too early in terms of specific dates. Thanks, Dean.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Kessler: Hi there. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks, guys. Maybe starting with the question on your inflation or deflation outlook for 2024, what your current expectation is? And what would need to happen in the backdrop for us to see either deflation or a return to more modest inflation? And in the event that we see deflation, is there a scenario in which you can hold or still expand margins, even in that kind of backdrop?
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, thanks for the question. As you know, we'll certainly provide a lot more specific details of our outlook for 2024 when we get to our quarter four earnings in March. And we're continuing, as I'm sure many are in the market, to look at all the data points we see both internally and externally. We're probably looking at some of the same data sources that you are from the top likes of USDA and other published sources. I think our view right now, we recognize we don't have the perfect crystal ball and we'll continue to watch and evaluate how we see the outlook for next year. But overall, most of the data that we're seeing would tend to point towards more of a typical year next year for food-at-home with food-at-home inflation being in the low single-digit range. We certainly think there are different scenarios that can play out. And of course, we'll look to adapt our model as we would need to, if those were the case, but that would be the data that we're watching. And we'll certainly provide more color when we get to the March earnings and talk specifically about our 2024 views.
Rodney McMullen: And one of the things that Gary always reminds me of, if you look over the last 50 years, there's only been two years out of the last 50 where it's been negative, where there's been actual deflation in a year. And as you know, we've been able to maintain and create strong business results in all environments, whether it's inflationary or deflationary, and you just manage accordingly.
Michael Kessler: Okay, great. And then, a quick follow-up on the fuel business, which had higher-than-expected profitability. So, can you talk about what drove that? And is there any interplay, I guess, between that business and the core supermarket business, if there's any balancing of the profitability dynamics and what you're able to earn to kind of manage the P&L? Or this is being managed separately and it just happened to come in a little stronger in Q3? Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, Gary mentioned it, but we're super proud of our fuel team and the partnership with all the divisions. We had a significant increase in the amount of fuel rewards that were issued, so we really look at leveraging both of the businesses to support each other. The other thing that the fuel team has done a nice job on is making sure from an efficiency standpoint on deliveries, on procurement and all the ingredients as well. So really proud of what they've done, but it really is we leverage both sides of the business to support each other and feel really good about where that business turned out. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Montani: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on two fronts. One was just if you could discuss the overall competitive backdrop? And then, secondly, we've heard a fair amount of promotions could uptick into next year. And I guess the question on that would be, what do you see in terms of vendor support versus you all having to fund that yourselves? And then, the follow-up was just OG&A dollar growth. Is there still potential for $1 billion cost-out into '24? And what kind of dollar growth should we look for underlying in the fourth quarter?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I'll answer the competitive backdrop and promotions, and if Gary wants to add anything, he can. And then, I'll let Gary ask about -- or answer the OG&A. If you look at overall, from a competitive standpoint, the market feels very similar than what it has been for a long time. If you look at the promotional activity, CPGs are increasing their funding on promotional. And I think there's two things driving that. One is CPG is not being satisfied with their tonnage so they're increasing the amount of support. The other thing for everyone is the supply chain constraints that would have been in place a year ago and two years ago is real getting back to normal. So, people are beginning to feel comfortable on promoting again, where the worst thing that could have happened is for us or for a CPG to promote something and then not have adequate supply. So, it really is behaviors getting back to pre-COVID. And even if you look at shopping during Thanksgiving, it was really more last minute, which really reflected, if you go back and look at pre COVID, it's kind of what it was, and people getting comfortable there will be products there when they go to buy it. So both great questions, but that's really what we're seeing right now. And Gary, on the OG&A.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Rodney. So, in OG&A, I'll just maybe take a step back as well and just mention a couple of points that I talked about in the third quarter. As we looked at the third quarter going into it, we would have expected OG&A to be a little bit lower as a rate. The things that were in the plan would have been the investments in average hourly rates and increasing wages for our associates in our stores and supply chain network and also the impact of ESI, and they were very much in line with what we expected. The real differences in the third quarter were that we did make some decisions during the quarter to make some strategic investments that we believe will help set up 2024 and beyond in terms of continued revenue growth, but also additional cost savings. So, as we look at the fourth quarter, we actually believe that the trends in average hourly rate will continue, and of course, Express Scripts will continue to be a factor. But outside of that, we'd expect OG&A to be relatively flat during the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still see both a sort of tailwind from initiatives that we've launched this year that will have a run rate benefit into next year. And we still see good line of sight to continued cost savings by leveraging technology and improving efficiency, driving continued improvement in cost to serve in digital and a number of areas of the business. So, we would remain confident that we see a good line of sight to continue to find that sort of 3% to 5% productivity improvements that we target to make sure we can continue to invest in our customers and continue to invest in our associates.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John, please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with, can you talk to -- if you think about the promotional basket, proactive versus reactive on your end, right, kind of is it -- would you say, I don't know, 80% proactive, 20% reactive? I don't know how you think about that. And then, on the reactive side, it would seem that those without a loyalty program would be at a disadvantage to you and that you can see what's going on in the market and possibly respond where yours is more stealth. Is that even remotely how you run the business, right, where you can respond to others based on what you see out there?
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, John, for the question. By far, the majority, and when I say majority would be almost all would be proactive versus reactive. Now, all our teams will check prices every single week and there'll be adjustments based on that. But by far, the majority of our discounts are proactive. And some of that is what you can see in an ad. A lot of that is the things that you've mentioned in terms of direct to individual household offers. It's one of the things that we believe the reason why our loyal households continue to grow and some of those aspects is once you become a Kroger shopper, you're getting those loyal customer mailings, which will allow you to stretch your budget more. And there's also personalized offers that you can go to look at coupons and download those, and there's significant increase in those. So, when you look at -- when you shop with us, obviously, we are a promotional merchant. But when you look at the rewards that we offer between fuel rewards and other rewards and our loyal customer mailings, our basket price overall is within less than cents of our biggest competitor. It's just we go to market and offer a little different way. But it is the reason why loyal shoppers are so important to us because that's the shopper that really gets the full value equation from us.
Gary Millerchip: Rodney, maybe the one thing I would add to John's question, too, the second part would be, I think, John, it's one of the reasons why we do have additional confidence in how we can navigate through the environment is that I think as a combination of our reward program and more customers engaging digitally post COVID, it really does create the ability to channel the dollars in a way that give the customer the most impact and most value while also being able to target it rather than having to sort of peanut butter spread it across in different directions. And I think it's a different dynamic now compared to maybe five, 10 years ago in the way that we're able to personalize that value and go to market.
Rodney McMullen: You've been -- you've followed us for a long time and you would have heard us use the word cherry-pickers and really what it is trying to make sure we do is to give value to customers that are loyal to us as opposed to somebody that's just shopping a discounted item that we're not making any money on.
John Heinbockel: And then maybe as a follow-up, so it sounds like volume is slightly -- is negative, right? I don't know if it's negative 1% or a little more than that, but volume is negative. Is that fair, low single-digit? When do you think that returns to positive territory? And is that solely driven -- if you looked at the budget-conscious customers, because I know a couple of quarters ago, you broke that out. Is that negativity largely driven by that cohort?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look, volume would be slightly negative. If you look, we -- our trends have improved for four quarters in a row from a trend standpoint. That would be largely driven by the value shopper or customers on a budget. And the half full and half empty, the half empty is obviously that's being driven by that customer. Some of that's driven because of the impact from inflation. Part of it's -- or SNAP is down about 30%. The full part is the customers that are loyal, we're continuing to grow with that customer and that customer's profitability is meaningfully better than the value shopper. Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank. Krisztina, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Krisztina Katai: Hi, good morning. So Rodney, I wanted to ask you just a conceptual question on grocery sector and the level of competition, right? Because if we're thinking about it, why wouldn't the sector be more competitive as we head into 2024? The consumer remains under pressure. Some of the low end is under increased pressure. CPGs are raising their support, volumes continue to lag. So that is question one, just conceptually, why wouldn't that be the case? And secondly, how is Kroger positioned in a potentially no inflation to even deflationary backdrop relative to the base case of a normal food-at-home year of low single-digit inflation?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look at, one of the things that makes this industry a lot of fun is we always assume that the business will continue to be more competitive. And if you look at our fundamental business model over the last five years or 10 years or 15 years, every year, we assume that it's going to be more competitive. We worked really hard to identify process changes and cost reductions so that we can continue to fund wage increases and invest in lowering prices for the customer. So, when we look at 2024, and obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail early next year when we give guidance, but right now, we don't see that environment any different than what we would have felt for the last five years or 10 years or 15 years. And the positive is customers get a better value every year and they get a better experience every year. And when you look at for us, one of the things that we think is important for the customers, the customer doesn't have to compromise. So, they get amazing fresh product that will last a long time when they get at home, with amazing friendly associates, with the smile and support that everything in their basket plus a little bit an extra piece of cheese or something they've engaged with Murray, so -- and not have to compromise from a pricing standpoint. So, when you look overall, we feel very good in terms of how we're positioned with the customers that really appreciate what we offer.
Gary Millerchip: Maybe, Rodney, one thing I would just add, too, Krisztina, specific to 2024, a couple of things for Kroger that we think are helpful as we look into next year. One is, of course, that we're cycling the impact of Express Scripts when we get to January and we'll start to see that flow through in the early periods of the year. And then secondly, one of the things that we've seen, as we look at 2023, many states, as you know, reduced the amount of SNAP dollars that were available in the market, and those happened sort of around the middle part of our Q1 last year or this year, I should say. What we've seen in one or two markets where we're cycling those earlier markets where they reduced the SNAP dollars, it certainly starts to create a bit of a different trend in the growth in those markets, too. So, we do think there's, for the industry and specifically for the markets that we operate in, as you start to cycle the impact of those SNAP dollars, which perhaps had a bit more of an impact than we were originally thinking they might across the industry, that starts to create some, I think, tailwind in the industry towards next year's growth as well.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Krisztina.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Ed, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ed Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Ed Kelly: Gary, I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. I think you said that the Q4 gross margin, you expect to be flattish. If you could just confirm that. And then looking out, is the base case for '24 that, that flattish trend would continue? And then, within that context, I'm curious about shrink. And maybe just educate us a little bit on when you do your accounts, the visibility you have on where you stand in shrink, and do you believe it's peaked?
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Ed. So, the first part of the question, yes, you're essentially right that we -- I said in my prepared comments that we would expect Q4 to look very similar to Q3. The way that I sort of would break that down is that we've been equally as pleased with the progress that we've seen in the margin improvement plan initiatives that we saw in the earlier part of the year as well. So, we continue to see strong benefits from Our Brands, strong benefits from sourcing, health and wellness, of course, with Express Scripts is a tailwind this year to gross margin, and supply chain and alternative profits. All those areas continue to generate tailwinds in our gross margin rate. What we did in the third quarter is we did invest more in gross margin to balance those benefits partly in increased pricing and promotion, as Rodney mentioned earlier. And we did also increase advertising costs during the quarter as well. So, those would have been the differences quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we saw and what we would expect to continue to be a similar pattern as we think about the fourth quarter. I'd say as we look into beyond 2023, we certainly still see a lot of potential for the tailwinds that I mentioned around Our Brands sourcing, these areas where we believe that we are on a multiyear path to continue to drive improvement and drive growth. And of course, alternative profit streams continues to grow at a double-digit pace off a bigger base as well. So, I think we still have a lot of confidence in those levers. And what we're doing is making sure we're balancing the business to set ourselves up for continued sustained growth in the future. From a shrink perspective, we would still see shrink as a headwind, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I would say, it's probably somewhat less dramatic for us than maybe some of our peer group because while we have a general merchandise business that's impacted, it's less impacted than probably some of the big-box retailers, but it would still be a headwind to our gross margin rate that would have impacted the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. That headwind actually would have been less than it was in the second quarter, not dramatically, but it would have eased somewhat. So, it's still something that we have to work through and continue to offset, but we are seeing at least the trend in terms of year-over-year growth decelerate, but it would still be a headwind today because of the crime and organized retail crime factors I mentioned earlier.
Rodney McMullen: The other thing I think is important to remember is a lot of our shrink is in our fresh departments. And our fresh departments, actually, a lot of that is, you can manage it by changing processes and using technology. And our teams have done a great job actually on improving shrink in the fresh departments because of our store teams partnering with warehouse teams on processes and leveraging technology as well, and I think as a big chunk of the trend -- slight trend improvements that Gary mentioned.
Ed Kelly: Great point.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky: Rodney, could you talk a little bit about the economy's effect and inflation on your digital business, and I'm thinking particularly about customers' willingness to spend money on any delivery fees or membership fees, and also how the economy might be impacting delivery volumes and digital order volumes?
Rodney McMullen: If you look at overall -- thanks, Chuck. If you look at overall, inflation is definitely stabilizing overall. And it's -- from a customer standpoint, they appreciate the stabilization but they also know the fact that if you look at over the last two years, they've had to endure a lot of inflation. And if you look at some of the fresh departments, some of that has actually returned back to normal. But if you look at on the process side, you wouldn't see that. So, if you look at like eggs, for an example, eggs are significantly deflationary. And we'll all be happy when we get to the point where we're cycling that early next year or next year. If you look at customer behavior, it's fascinating. Customers do a lot of work to save where they want to save or feel like they need to save, so in pack size, if you look at moving to Our Brands versus some of the national brands. But if you look at membership fees and delivery fees and things like that, that business continues to grow strongly. And in fact, it was up double digits and that's what drove the 11%. I'm sure part of that, and any time I talk to a politician, I always remind them, if you look at customers on a budget, they're under a lot of strain and they're doing a lot of behavior changes. If you look at customers that are not as focused on price because inflation hasn't affected them as much, that customers' behavior is still very strong, and they're still continuing to buy big packs, continuing to buy nicer wines, Murray's Cheese, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), things like that. So, we over-index with our membership program on customers that are more mainstream and upscale, so I'm sure that's part of the reason why we're not seeing the behavior change.
Chuck Cerankosky: Okay. Thanks for that. And just real quick, you're exiting the ghost kitchen business. Any particular reason for that?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, great question. Appreciate it. We test a lot of different things, and we'll move on to the next version of it. We still think food away-from-home is a huge growth opportunity for us and we'll continue to focus on it. The ghost kitchen, the few customers that used it, loved it, but it just wasn't enough. So, it's one of those things where you move on. So thanks, Chuck.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to Kroger's digital performance, another quarter of double-digit growth. Did anything surprise you on the digital front? And just any more color in terms of what you guys are seeing delivery versus pickup?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I'll start and let Gary finish. I wouldn't call it a surprise, but it's great to see that the NPS scores, both in terms of our year-on-year from a pickup standpoint and a delivery standpoint is very strong. If you look at our shed delivery business, the repeat rate continues to be strong. So it really is the customers really appreciate that white-glove experience. So, I don't want to make it sound like we're surprised by it, but it's nice to see what we thought play out. Gary, I'll let you...
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, I think you said it well, Rodney. I think the only thing I would add, Rupesh, is that we've said before, we believe that digital is a growth engine for the company. And I think everything we continue to see gives us that belief it will continue to be an opportunity to drive deeper customer engagement and growth. And I mentioned in a comment earlier, but the thing we didn't talk about in the script was we are seeing continued improvement in profitability. So, it's helping profitable growth as well as we're lowering the cost to fill an order, driving more efficiency through technology and continuing to see media revenue growth. So that's the only piece I think that I would reinforce.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kenneth Goldman: Hi, thank you. I'll take a shot here on next year. I know you're not in a position to really give numbers and I wouldn't ask about that now, but you did talk about hopefully having low single-digit sort of normal inflation next year. You highlighted a healthy amount of productivity you expected or expecting. But you also mentioned that maybe your unit growth right now is a little bit disappointing, and you'll surely be lapping some challenging fuel margins that I imagine you won't assume will recur. So, I'm just trying to get a sense if you have maybe sluggish units, fuel comps are tough, to get to your earnings growth algo for next year, do you theoretically have to find other drivers that are better than their algo to offset those headwinds? I just want to kind of get a sense of how to think about at least some initial headwinds and tailwinds into next year, if that all makes sense.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. As you mentioned, we'll definitely share a lot more color, as you might expect, when we get to March. I think as we think about the model and just taking a bigger picture step back, we certainly believe that we've, over the last few years, built a more diverse ecosystem as a company. So, of course, food-at-home is an important part of -- the sort of -- it drives the flywheel. But as you know, we've been continuing to grow our fuel business, continue to grow health and wellness this year even with the impact of Express Groups, and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. So, we look at it more as a journey and we do believe that as we're building the strength in that ecosystem, it creates the -- a new way to generate value for our shareholders over time as we've talked about at previous investor meetings. I mean, I think some of the points you've raised would certainly be the areas where we'll be focusing on. I don't think it's a different strategy for Kroger. It's how do we continue to drive that flywheel as we think about taking cost out of our business so that we can invest more in customers and associates, continuing to drive traffic so we can continue to grow the alternative profit businesses. And we do think there's opportunity for margin improvement to continue beyond 2023, because of the initiatives we're driving around sourcing, supply chain, alternative profit streams, et cetera. So, I think from our perspective, certainly, if you were in a period where you weren't seeing sales growth for a sustained period of time because our model is built on sales growth, we'd have to look at our cost base and we'll look at our cost base in certain areas to be more productive. But we still believe that food-at-home is -- will normalize in the typical pattern that we see of that sort of 1% to 2% inflation over time and sort of 2% to 3% food-at-home growth. And we think our model is really well set up to be able to drive growth within that framework.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ken. The only other thing I would add to Gary's comment is if you look at our seamless business, we would expect that to continue to make progress as well, as I mentioned earlier. Thanks, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As you talk to your processed food and CPG partners, what are they telling you about their desire to further raise prices into next year, given your expectation that there could be typical inflation across the assortments that would necessitate that [indiscernible] prices go up? And this is against the backdrop where volumes continue to go down, you're providing more support. Why are they not rolling back prices to try and drive volume? And as part of that, given that you used your P&L to fund promotions a bit more in the third quarter, is that a sign that you are running into the limitation of the vendors willing to provide support for you to do these promotions? Thank you very much.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael. If you look at overall, they say in economics, all short statements are wrong. And you have CPGs that are all over the board in terms of their approach. Some CPGs are very willing to give up tonnage. And if they are, Our Brands will stay -- will be there for a customer to give them incredible value. And what we find is when a customer tries Our Brands, our repeat rate is incredibly high because of the quality and the value for the money. If you look in the quarter, in terms of funding, it was really done by CPGs and us. And as I mentioned earlier, CPGs were more aggressive in funding some of the promotions in the third quarter than the second quarter, and would expect that to continue. We are seeing more CPGs worrying about their tonnage growth, and I think that's part of what's driving that willingness, too. So, I appreciate the question, and thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Good morning, Rodney and Gary. Thanks for taking our questions.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Kelly Bania: I wanted to go back to the comment about building a more diverse ecosystem and talk a little bit more about alternative profit growth. I think there was a comment that, that is still growing double digits, which I think would mean around $150 million to $200 million in incremental year-over-year profit. But maybe just wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on that if that's the right ballpark. And how many more years can this business continue to grow at double-digit rate into the coming years?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I don't know that Gary and I will want to give the specifics for '24 on the alt profit since we're still going through the process. But we would expect alt profit to be a meaningful contributor of growth next year. And that's really driven by two things. One is our continued growth in our digital business, which is supporting our media business growth. And we think we're just getting started on that. If you look in the media world, your competitors are Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and then a lot of other players. And one of the things that we think transparency is so important in being able to give people good data is we think that is incredibly helpful relative to the Googles and Metas and others. So, we see a long-term opportunity to continue to grow the business there. And the specifics, I don't know that we want to get there either. And if you look at some of the other alternative profit businesses, some of those, we have wide variance of performance within the company. So, part of that growth is just driven by taking best-in-class within our own company and growing that as well. So, Kelly, I appreciate the question. And thanks, everyone, for all the questions. And as always, I'd like to take a few moments to share some comments with our associates listening in. To start, I'd like to say a huge thank you for all the hard work that you've done to make the holidays be so memorable for our customers and what you will do for the -- following the rest of the holiday season to make it equally as memorable for customers. As you know, food plays an important part in any celebration, and it provides an opportunity for people to connect and people that we love, especially with them and sharing special moments. If you had a chance to see our holiday film, you saw that idea come to life. And if you haven't seen our holiday film, you can go to YouTube to look at the full film. And it really does recognize that food connects us all. And whether that's honoring family traditions or creating new family ones, I've just been so inspired to see how our associates and our customers on sharing their videos and the unique ways they celebrate the holidays. As I said before, thank you for everything you do to create special memories for our customers every single day. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Robert Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen, and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline our discussion topics this morning. I will begin by covering the current retail environment and how the strength of Kroger's value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then, Gary will cover our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons, before we open it up for questions. Now, turning to our third quarter. Kroger's third quarter results highlight the strength and diversity of our business model in a challenged operating environment. A strong fuel performance and growth in our alternative profit businesses supported continued adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth. As consumer spending tightens, we are focused on providing customers with exceptional value by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, personalized promotions and rewards. We are growing households and increasing loyalty, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Customers are managing many economic factors that are pressuring their spending, including higher interest rates, reduced savings, and fewer government benefits, including SNAP. Although inflation is decelerating, customers are still adjusting to the impacts from eight consecutive quarters of broad and significant inflation. During the quarter, Kroger grew higher income households once again as our attractive mix of quality, value and convenience continues to drive engagement. By buying larger packs, more fresh items and more premium Our Brands products, these households are more profitable. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are actively looking for value, and our budget-conscious customers are under more significant spending pressure. We are also looking for ways to support customers with additional value, including in-store displays with everyday staples at low price points. We've seen a great response from all customers to these offers. But engagement from our budget-conscious households has been especially strong. Customers purchasing these offer items are making more trips and buying more units, not only recognizing the value with these displays, but the value across the entire store. To help more customers manage their budget, we are only deepening our commitment to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Our personalized promotions are an increasingly critical way for customers to save on items that matter most to them. We are applying analytics to Kroger's unmatched purchase data to strike the right balance between the depth and breadth of promotions. To ensure customers were able to enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, for example, we created a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person, which represents a lower price than last year. We have a long history of delivering value to our customers by providing a broad assortment of fresh foods at low prices through our unique omnichannel shopping experience. We achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of total household growth and increased loyal households even faster, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Now, I'll provide more details about how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. Starting with seamless. [Technical Difficulty] Our digital business delivered a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses. Multiple tailwinds are driving our sales momentum, including growth in both households and visits. Our new two-hour pickup service available in more than one-third of our stores also contributed to our success in the quarter. To become the online food retailer of choice, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment. Our teams improved key customer experience metrics in pickup, increasing fill rates and reducing wait times during the quarter. This resulted in an improved net promoter scores. Our customer fulfillment centers again led our delivery growth, where we continue to rapidly increase households. Our delivery customers enjoy the convenience of on-time refrigerated delivery directly to their doorstep with zero compromise on freshness, quality, and value. Turning to personalization. Investments in our personalized capabilities ensure we are meeting elevated customer demand for savings and enables us to deploy promotional dollars more effectively. Digital offers have increased compared to last year and our personalization capabilities have resulted in even more significant increase in redemptions, driving loyalty and increasing digitally-engaged households this quarter by 13%. Digitally-engaged households are incredibly valuable to our model as they are more loyal, spend nearly 3 times more with us, and accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. Now, I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model supported earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Growth in alternative profit businesses remained strong in the third quarter with balanced growth across the portfolio. The strength of our seamless ecosystem and elevated digital engagement is having a flywheel effect, creating the traffic and the data needed to drive growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, a higher-margin profit stream. Recently, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of KPM. This quarter, KPM made an important step in its journey to become the most trusted and transparent media company. By activating ad buying platforms, we are offering more self-service solutions to meet clients where they are today, providing advertisers more direct access to custom Kroger audiences. This first iteration has already launched, and KPM expects to expand to other buying platforms in the future. These new innovative features will help accelerate KPM's impressive growth by allowing advertisers to reduce waste and enhance measurement tools. Kroger Health had a strong quarter that exceeded our internal expectations and helped drive sales and profit growth. Our decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our customers and shareholders. Our teams have done an excellent job retaining patients and utilizing our pharmacists' extra capacity to devote more time to patient care, including growing our number of vaccinations. Gary will provide more on the financial impact of this later. During the quarter, we continued to see rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs in our retail pharmacies. While the long-term impacts of these drugs on customer buying habits are unknown, Kroger's 'Food as Medicine' philosophy positions us well to support our customers' health and wellness goals. Our comprehensive approach includes healthcare services, professional dietitians, and proprietary tools like our nutrition rating app, OptUP, which are all designed to support healthy living and to do so holistically. While we pride ourselves on data and insights, the patient data in our pharmacy operations is separate from our customer loyalty data and is protected by privacy laws. We are committed to using our data in an appropriate manner while not jeopardizing customers' trust. For now, we have not seen any major macro shifts in customer eating habits or spending behaviors. Food trends are constantly evolving, and we are committed to offering products that meet our customers' needs. For customers looking to adopt healthier habits with or without the help of these drugs, we are well-positioned to provide important healthcare services and healthy food options. At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, and I'm so impressed by the many ways our associates bring this to life every day in the ways they support our customers and each other. We know when associates are connected to our purpose, they feel connected to Kroger. Our annual Kroger Wellness Festival is just one example of living our purpose. This festival is one of the nation's largest health and wellness events, showcasing more than a 150 experiences and food offerings. Sponsors and celebrities joined Kroger in hundreds of thousands of visitors to share our vision for better physical, mental, and emotional health for families. It was wonderful to see the level of support and participation in this important mission. Also this quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which highlighted Kroger's significant progress on our 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' journey to expand access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food, and to reduce waste, especially food waste, across our footprint. Since we launched 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' in 2017, Kroger has donated more than 3 billion meals to feed hungry families, including more than 1.3 billion to fight food insecurity and nearly 600 million pounds of surplus food to our food bank partners. I am so proud of our teams and their efforts to reach these incredible milestones. Our associates are the driving force behind our success by delivering an outstanding customer experience and helping make the holidays even more special for our customers. We facilitate this through our long-standing commitment to invest in associate wages and benefits and training tools to advance their career growth. Feed Your Future, our continuing education benefit, is one of the important ways we make Kroger a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. This benefit provides up to $21,000 lifeline, and it's helped almost 6,000 associates this year alone, with approximately 90% of these participants being hourly. Our focus on development is contributing to strong improvements in retention, which includes associate continuity and a more consistent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are allowing Kroger to navigate a challenged environment, characterized by tightening consumer spending and food-at-home disinflation. We achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% this quarter, while also providing greater value for our customers, higher wages for our associates, and investing in strategic initiatives that will support future growth. This was made possible by our teams delivering strong performances across our margin expansion initiatives, fuel, alternative profit businesses, and health and wellness. Our year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023, building on record results over the prior three years. I'll now provide more detail on our third quarter. Identical sales without fuel decreased 0.6%. Underlying growth would have been positive 1% adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first two quarters of the year, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel and a negative effect on the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall net effect on operating profit was slightly positive. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle the impact of Express Scripts at the start of the new calendar year. Turning back to identical sales without fuel. As Rodney shared earlier, our seamless ecosystem is a critical component of our growth strategy, building customer loyalty and fueling our alternative profit businesses. Digital sales were a highlight in the quarter, growing 11%. Our overall sales continue to be affected by industry-wide disinflation. Inflation ended quarter three in the low-single digits, approximately 270 basis points lower than the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw inflation decline at a slower pace, and we would expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining positive at the year-end. Encouragingly, units have shown signs of improvement as inflation has decelerated, and we have sequentially improved units for four straight quarters. However, unit growth rates have lagged the rate of inflation decline and have not improved at the pace we would have expected. As a team, we are laser-focused on returning to unit growth and expect improvement in volumes to continue for the balance of the year. Gross margin was 22% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel increased 3 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we increased investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, and we were able to successfully fund these investments by continuing to execute our long-term margin improvement plan, including Our Brands optimization, sourcing efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Shrink was a headwind to gross margin during the quarter, primarily due to the continued rise in industry-wide theft and organized retail crime. We are investing in initiatives to mitigate shrink and protect our associates and customers in our stores. Looking ahead, we would expect these same factors that influence gross margin in quarter three will drive a similar outcome for gross margin rate in the fourth quarter. During quarter three, we recorded a LIFO charge of $29 million compared to a charge of $152 million for the same quarter last year. This reduction was due to inflation returning to low-single digits compared to double-digit growth experienced last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 32 basis points excluding fuel and adjustment items. The increase in OG&A rate was driven by planned investments in associate wages and benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. During the quarter, we also made the decision to invest in a number of strategic initiatives that are expected to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Investments were partially offset by execution of cost saving initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. We are confident in our ability to effectively manage costs and continue to deliver savings by eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience. We continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities across the business and remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. In the fourth quarter, we would expect our OG&A rate to be relatively flat compared to last year. Kroger Health is an important component of our value creation model and is delivering profitable growth in 2023. During the quarter, the team exceeded our internal goal for the number of vaccinations administered, and the higher profit margins associated with these vaccines helped offset the negative impact on margin rate from growth in GLP-1 drugs. As Rodney shared earlier, we are excited about the momentum in health and wellness, and see significant potential for future profitable growth in this area of our business. Fuel is also a key part of our strategy and through our rewards program is another way that we deliver value for customers and increase loyalty. Our fuel team did an outstanding job delivering results that were ahead of expectations in the third quarter. Our customers saved 14% more in rewards per fuel purchase compared to last year, which led to gallon sales outpacing the industry. The average retail price of fuel was $3.77 this quarter versus $3.84 last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.57 this quarter versus $0.50 last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. Kroger has made substantial investments over the last five years in our associates, raising the average hourly wage by more than 33%. We remain committed to supporting our associates with sustainable investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that will, at the same time, allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities that we serve. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drug, Dallas Meat and four stores in Roundy's, in total covering more than 19,000 associates. We have now ratified all agreements that were scheduled for negotiation in 2023. Turning to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and the disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4, which remains well below our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.3 to 2.5. This positions us well to execute our financing strategy to close the proposed merger with Albertsons early in 2024 and then quickly return to within our target leverage range post-merger. As I wrap up my comments on the quarter, let me provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Today, we updated our full-year guidance to reflect the impact of near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation. We now expect full-year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1%, and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023. Our latest sales trends would put us on track to achieve the midpoint of our updated annual sales guidance range. Importantly, we would expect to exit quarter four with a stronger sales trend than our overall results for the quarter as we start to cycle the effect of Express Scripts in January. We believe we are well-positioned to navigate near-term headwinds and the strength we are seeing in our alternative profit businesses, health and wellness and fuel, combined with a lower expected LIFO charge, gives us the confidence to raise the lower-end of our full-year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance range. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 to $4.60. And looking forward, Kroger remains committed to delivering attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with  Albertsons Companies . As of November 15, 2023, Kroger certified substantial compliance with the second request issued by the FTC. We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction. This step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement, including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S is a well-qualified buyer who meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction and will ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger. Frontline (NYSE:FRO) associates will remain employed and existing collective bargaining agreements will continue. We have made a compelling case to both Kroger and Albertsons stakeholders. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for our customers by lowering prices beginning on day one, extends our commitment to associates by increasing wages and benefits, and deepens trust with our communities by keeping stores open to assure America has access to fresh and affordable food. In terms of integration planning, we are progressing well. Our integration teams have made significant progress toward our first goal, which is to ensure continuity for associates and customers at closing. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both organizations and how we'll be able to learn from each other to provide customers with an even stronger food retail experience and compete even more effectively against larger non-union operators in the future. In closing, Kroger delivered another quarter of solid results. We are demonstrating our ability to manage through a more challenged environment and remain committed to balancing our investments in our associates and in lower prices for our customers, while continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Dean Rosenblum of Bernstein. Dean, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dean Rosenblum: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Hey, my question is really about a debate regarding the gross profit and operating profit impact of increasing digital sales. I mean, online was -- digital sales were up 11% this quarter on a total comp, ex Express Scripts of 1%, which says it's growing share. Can you help us understand -- I know you think about it in terms of the whole digital ecosystem, including the alternative revenues. But in terms of the actual operating profit contribution from digital relative to the stores, can you help us understand how to think about that as that mix continues to increase?
Rodney McMullen: If you look currently, digital would not be as profitable as stores. We do believe over time, that will change, and we think that'll change by multiple things, the overall ecosystem. If you look at the pickup, we continue to make significant progress on reducing the cost to serve a customer on pickup. If you look at our sheds, we continue to make progress on our sheds to get them to where the profitability of the shed would be the same as the store. So, if you just step back, kind of, we view job one is make sure we don't lose the customer. And what we find is that customer over time will spend more with us when they're engaged with us through pickup, delivery, and in-store. And then, obviously, if you look at the incremental profitability that is making meaningful progress, and we also, when you include media as well, that's making progress. So, if you look initially, it is not as profitable, but we have every expectations over time that it will be.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, Rodney, maybe just to add, Dean, a couple of specific data points. Can you hear me okay?
Dean Rosenblum: Yeah, please.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Dean, I think we talked, Dean, before about, we sort of bucket our digital business into two areas, the sort of the business prior to launching our CFCs, which will be pickup and delivery through our third-party providers, and then our customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado (LON:OCDO). We've talked before about the pickup and delivery business sort of having a pass-through profitability rate on incremental sales of around 5% or mid-single-digit percent and the store being sort of north of 15%. And we talked a couple of years ago about being on a journey to improving that pass-through rate through some of the things that Rodney mentioned around improving mix, around improving media revenue per transaction, and then also lowering the cost to fill a digital order. We've made good progress on all three of those areas, and we would certainly see now sort of the digital pass-through profitability heading towards that double-digit rate sort of on that journey towards getting towards parity in terms of overall profitability. And then, the Ocado CFCs, we're really still very much in the early stages of that journey where the total investment is sort of starting to peak and we're starting to see tailwinds in that profitability as we start to achieve more scale in those facilities.
Dean Rosenblum: That's great. Thanks so much, Gary. My follow-up question is, you mentioned certifying the second request substantial completion on November 15th. That would suggest that the FTC now has 30 days to either make a decision or to extend the period. Do you have any sense right now as to whether we might expect some sort of an FTC decision or that the FTC is more likely to extend the time for that decision?
Rodney McMullen: Dean, it's a great question. And if you look as you -- in our prepared comments, we expect to close in early 2024 as we have all along. We continue to have a cooperative relationship with the FTC and other interested parties, and it's still too early in terms of specific dates. Thanks, Dean.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Kessler: Hi there. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks, guys. Maybe starting with the question on your inflation or deflation outlook for 2024, what your current expectation is? And what would need to happen in the backdrop for us to see either deflation or a return to more modest inflation? And in the event that we see deflation, is there a scenario in which you can hold or still expand margins, even in that kind of backdrop?
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, thanks for the question. As you know, we'll certainly provide a lot more specific details of our outlook for 2024 when we get to our quarter four earnings in March. And we're continuing, as I'm sure many are in the market, to look at all the data points we see both internally and externally. We're probably looking at some of the same data sources that you are from the top likes of USDA and other published sources. I think our view right now, we recognize we don't have the perfect crystal ball and we'll continue to watch and evaluate how we see the outlook for next year. But overall, most of the data that we're seeing would tend to point towards more of a typical year next year for food-at-home with food-at-home inflation being in the low single-digit range. We certainly think there are different scenarios that can play out. And of course, we'll look to adapt our model as we would need to, if those were the case, but that would be the data that we're watching. And we'll certainly provide more color when we get to the March earnings and talk specifically about our 2024 views.
Rodney McMullen: And one of the things that Gary always reminds me of, if you look over the last 50 years, there's only been two years out of the last 50 where it's been negative, where there's been actual deflation in a year. And as you know, we've been able to maintain and create strong business results in all environments, whether it's inflationary or deflationary, and you just manage accordingly.
Michael Kessler: Okay, great. And then, a quick follow-up on the fuel business, which had higher-than-expected profitability. So, can you talk about what drove that? And is there any interplay, I guess, between that business and the core supermarket business, if there's any balancing of the profitability dynamics and what you're able to earn to kind of manage the P&L? Or this is being managed separately and it just happened to come in a little stronger in Q3? Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, Gary mentioned it, but we're super proud of our fuel team and the partnership with all the divisions. We had a significant increase in the amount of fuel rewards that were issued, so we really look at leveraging both of the businesses to support each other. The other thing that the fuel team has done a nice job on is making sure from an efficiency standpoint on deliveries, on procurement and all the ingredients as well. So really proud of what they've done, but it really is we leverage both sides of the business to support each other and feel really good about where that business turned out. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Montani: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on two fronts. One was just if you could discuss the overall competitive backdrop? And then, secondly, we've heard a fair amount of promotions could uptick into next year. And I guess the question on that would be, what do you see in terms of vendor support versus you all having to fund that yourselves? And then, the follow-up was just OG&A dollar growth. Is there still potential for $1 billion cost-out into '24? And what kind of dollar growth should we look for underlying in the fourth quarter?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I'll answer the competitive backdrop and promotions, and if Gary wants to add anything, he can. And then, I'll let Gary ask about -- or answer the OG&A. If you look at overall, from a competitive standpoint, the market feels very similar than what it has been for a long time. If you look at the promotional activity, CPGs are increasing their funding on promotional. And I think there's two things driving that. One is CPG is not being satisfied with their tonnage so they're increasing the amount of support. The other thing for everyone is the supply chain constraints that would have been in place a year ago and two years ago is real getting back to normal. So, people are beginning to feel comfortable on promoting again, where the worst thing that could have happened is for us or for a CPG to promote something and then not have adequate supply. So, it really is behaviors getting back to pre-COVID. And even if you look at shopping during Thanksgiving, it was really more last minute, which really reflected, if you go back and look at pre COVID, it's kind of what it was, and people getting comfortable there will be products there when they go to buy it. So both great questions, but that's really what we're seeing right now. And Gary, on the OG&A.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Rodney. So, in OG&A, I'll just maybe take a step back as well and just mention a couple of points that I talked about in the third quarter. As we looked at the third quarter going into it, we would have expected OG&A to be a little bit lower as a rate. The things that were in the plan would have been the investments in average hourly rates and increasing wages for our associates in our stores and supply chain network and also the impact of ESI, and they were very much in line with what we expected. The real differences in the third quarter were that we did make some decisions during the quarter to make some strategic investments that we believe will help set up 2024 and beyond in terms of continued revenue growth, but also additional cost savings. So, as we look at the fourth quarter, we actually believe that the trends in average hourly rate will continue, and of course, Express Scripts will continue to be a factor. But outside of that, we'd expect OG&A to be relatively flat during the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still see both a sort of tailwind from initiatives that we've launched this year that will have a run rate benefit into next year. And we still see good line of sight to continued cost savings by leveraging technology and improving efficiency, driving continued improvement in cost to serve in digital and a number of areas of the business. So, we would remain confident that we see a good line of sight to continue to find that sort of 3% to 5% productivity improvements that we target to make sure we can continue to invest in our customers and continue to invest in our associates.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John, please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with, can you talk to -- if you think about the promotional basket, proactive versus reactive on your end, right, kind of is it -- would you say, I don't know, 80% proactive, 20% reactive? I don't know how you think about that. And then, on the reactive side, it would seem that those without a loyalty program would be at a disadvantage to you and that you can see what's going on in the market and possibly respond where yours is more stealth. Is that even remotely how you run the business, right, where you can respond to others based on what you see out there?
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, John, for the question. By far, the majority, and when I say majority would be almost all would be proactive versus reactive. Now, all our teams will check prices every single week and there'll be adjustments based on that. But by far, the majority of our discounts are proactive. And some of that is what you can see in an ad. A lot of that is the things that you've mentioned in terms of direct to individual household offers. It's one of the things that we believe the reason why our loyal households continue to grow and some of those aspects is once you become a Kroger shopper, you're getting those loyal customer mailings, which will allow you to stretch your budget more. And there's also personalized offers that you can go to look at coupons and download those, and there's significant increase in those. So, when you look at -- when you shop with us, obviously, we are a promotional merchant. But when you look at the rewards that we offer between fuel rewards and other rewards and our loyal customer mailings, our basket price overall is within less than cents of our biggest competitor. It's just we go to market and offer a little different way. But it is the reason why loyal shoppers are so important to us because that's the shopper that really gets the full value equation from us.
Gary Millerchip: Rodney, maybe the one thing I would add to John's question, too, the second part would be, I think, John, it's one of the reasons why we do have additional confidence in how we can navigate through the environment is that I think as a combination of our reward program and more customers engaging digitally post COVID, it really does create the ability to channel the dollars in a way that give the customer the most impact and most value while also being able to target it rather than having to sort of peanut butter spread it across in different directions. And I think it's a different dynamic now compared to maybe five, 10 years ago in the way that we're able to personalize that value and go to market.
Rodney McMullen: You've been -- you've followed us for a long time and you would have heard us use the word cherry-pickers and really what it is trying to make sure we do is to give value to customers that are loyal to us as opposed to somebody that's just shopping a discounted item that we're not making any money on.
John Heinbockel: And then maybe as a follow-up, so it sounds like volume is slightly -- is negative, right? I don't know if it's negative 1% or a little more than that, but volume is negative. Is that fair, low single-digit? When do you think that returns to positive territory? And is that solely driven -- if you looked at the budget-conscious customers, because I know a couple of quarters ago, you broke that out. Is that negativity largely driven by that cohort?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look, volume would be slightly negative. If you look, we -- our trends have improved for four quarters in a row from a trend standpoint. That would be largely driven by the value shopper or customers on a budget. And the half full and half empty, the half empty is obviously that's being driven by that customer. Some of that's driven because of the impact from inflation. Part of it's -- or SNAP is down about 30%. The full part is the customers that are loyal, we're continuing to grow with that customer and that customer's profitability is meaningfully better than the value shopper. Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank. Krisztina, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Krisztina Katai: Hi, good morning. So Rodney, I wanted to ask you just a conceptual question on grocery sector and the level of competition, right? Because if we're thinking about it, why wouldn't the sector be more competitive as we head into 2024? The consumer remains under pressure. Some of the low end is under increased pressure. CPGs are raising their support, volumes continue to lag. So that is question one, just conceptually, why wouldn't that be the case? And secondly, how is Kroger positioned in a potentially no inflation to even deflationary backdrop relative to the base case of a normal food-at-home year of low single-digit inflation?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look at, one of the things that makes this industry a lot of fun is we always assume that the business will continue to be more competitive. And if you look at our fundamental business model over the last five years or 10 years or 15 years, every year, we assume that it's going to be more competitive. We worked really hard to identify process changes and cost reductions so that we can continue to fund wage increases and invest in lowering prices for the customer. So, when we look at 2024, and obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail early next year when we give guidance, but right now, we don't see that environment any different than what we would have felt for the last five years or 10 years or 15 years. And the positive is customers get a better value every year and they get a better experience every year. And when you look at for us, one of the things that we think is important for the customers, the customer doesn't have to compromise. So, they get amazing fresh product that will last a long time when they get at home, with amazing friendly associates, with the smile and support that everything in their basket plus a little bit an extra piece of cheese or something they've engaged with Murray, so -- and not have to compromise from a pricing standpoint. So, when you look overall, we feel very good in terms of how we're positioned with the customers that really appreciate what we offer.
Gary Millerchip: Maybe, Rodney, one thing I would just add, too, Krisztina, specific to 2024, a couple of things for Kroger that we think are helpful as we look into next year. One is, of course, that we're cycling the impact of Express Scripts when we get to January and we'll start to see that flow through in the early periods of the year. And then secondly, one of the things that we've seen, as we look at 2023, many states, as you know, reduced the amount of SNAP dollars that were available in the market, and those happened sort of around the middle part of our Q1 last year or this year, I should say. What we've seen in one or two markets where we're cycling those earlier markets where they reduced the SNAP dollars, it certainly starts to create a bit of a different trend in the growth in those markets, too. So, we do think there's, for the industry and specifically for the markets that we operate in, as you start to cycle the impact of those SNAP dollars, which perhaps had a bit more of an impact than we were originally thinking they might across the industry, that starts to create some, I think, tailwind in the industry towards next year's growth as well.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Krisztina.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Ed, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ed Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Ed Kelly: Gary, I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. I think you said that the Q4 gross margin, you expect to be flattish. If you could just confirm that. And then looking out, is the base case for '24 that, that flattish trend would continue? And then, within that context, I'm curious about shrink. And maybe just educate us a little bit on when you do your accounts, the visibility you have on where you stand in shrink, and do you believe it's peaked?
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Ed. So, the first part of the question, yes, you're essentially right that we -- I said in my prepared comments that we would expect Q4 to look very similar to Q3. The way that I sort of would break that down is that we've been equally as pleased with the progress that we've seen in the margin improvement plan initiatives that we saw in the earlier part of the year as well. So, we continue to see strong benefits from Our Brands, strong benefits from sourcing, health and wellness, of course, with Express Scripts is a tailwind this year to gross margin, and supply chain and alternative profits. All those areas continue to generate tailwinds in our gross margin rate. What we did in the third quarter is we did invest more in gross margin to balance those benefits partly in increased pricing and promotion, as Rodney mentioned earlier. And we did also increase advertising costs during the quarter as well. So, those would have been the differences quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we saw and what we would expect to continue to be a similar pattern as we think about the fourth quarter. I'd say as we look into beyond 2023, we certainly still see a lot of potential for the tailwinds that I mentioned around Our Brands sourcing, these areas where we believe that we are on a multiyear path to continue to drive improvement and drive growth. And of course, alternative profit streams continues to grow at a double-digit pace off a bigger base as well. So, I think we still have a lot of confidence in those levers. And what we're doing is making sure we're balancing the business to set ourselves up for continued sustained growth in the future. From a shrink perspective, we would still see shrink as a headwind, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I would say, it's probably somewhat less dramatic for us than maybe some of our peer group because while we have a general merchandise business that's impacted, it's less impacted than probably some of the big-box retailers, but it would still be a headwind to our gross margin rate that would have impacted the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. That headwind actually would have been less than it was in the second quarter, not dramatically, but it would have eased somewhat. So, it's still something that we have to work through and continue to offset, but we are seeing at least the trend in terms of year-over-year growth decelerate, but it would still be a headwind today because of the crime and organized retail crime factors I mentioned earlier.
Rodney McMullen: The other thing I think is important to remember is a lot of our shrink is in our fresh departments. And our fresh departments, actually, a lot of that is, you can manage it by changing processes and using technology. And our teams have done a great job actually on improving shrink in the fresh departments because of our store teams partnering with warehouse teams on processes and leveraging technology as well, and I think as a big chunk of the trend -- slight trend improvements that Gary mentioned.
Ed Kelly: Great point.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky: Rodney, could you talk a little bit about the economy's effect and inflation on your digital business, and I'm thinking particularly about customers' willingness to spend money on any delivery fees or membership fees, and also how the economy might be impacting delivery volumes and digital order volumes?
Rodney McMullen: If you look at overall -- thanks, Chuck. If you look at overall, inflation is definitely stabilizing overall. And it's -- from a customer standpoint, they appreciate the stabilization but they also know the fact that if you look at over the last two years, they've had to endure a lot of inflation. And if you look at some of the fresh departments, some of that has actually returned back to normal. But if you look at on the process side, you wouldn't see that. So, if you look at like eggs, for an example, eggs are significantly deflationary. And we'll all be happy when we get to the point where we're cycling that early next year or next year. If you look at customer behavior, it's fascinating. Customers do a lot of work to save where they want to save or feel like they need to save, so in pack size, if you look at moving to Our Brands versus some of the national brands. But if you look at membership fees and delivery fees and things like that, that business continues to grow strongly. And in fact, it was up double digits and that's what drove the 11%. I'm sure part of that, and any time I talk to a politician, I always remind them, if you look at customers on a budget, they're under a lot of strain and they're doing a lot of behavior changes. If you look at customers that are not as focused on price because inflation hasn't affected them as much, that customers' behavior is still very strong, and they're still continuing to buy big packs, continuing to buy nicer wines, Murray's Cheese, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), things like that. So, we over-index with our membership program on customers that are more mainstream and upscale, so I'm sure that's part of the reason why we're not seeing the behavior change.
Chuck Cerankosky: Okay. Thanks for that. And just real quick, you're exiting the ghost kitchen business. Any particular reason for that?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, great question. Appreciate it. We test a lot of different things, and we'll move on to the next version of it. We still think food away-from-home is a huge growth opportunity for us and we'll continue to focus on it. The ghost kitchen, the few customers that used it, loved it, but it just wasn't enough. So, it's one of those things where you move on. So thanks, Chuck.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to Kroger's digital performance, another quarter of double-digit growth. Did anything surprise you on the digital front? And just any more color in terms of what you guys are seeing delivery versus pickup?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I'll start and let Gary finish. I wouldn't call it a surprise, but it's great to see that the NPS scores, both in terms of our year-on-year from a pickup standpoint and a delivery standpoint is very strong. If you look at our shed delivery business, the repeat rate continues to be strong. So it really is the customers really appreciate that white-glove experience. So, I don't want to make it sound like we're surprised by it, but it's nice to see what we thought play out. Gary, I'll let you...
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, I think you said it well, Rodney. I think the only thing I would add, Rupesh, is that we've said before, we believe that digital is a growth engine for the company. And I think everything we continue to see gives us that belief it will continue to be an opportunity to drive deeper customer engagement and growth. And I mentioned in a comment earlier, but the thing we didn't talk about in the script was we are seeing continued improvement in profitability. So, it's helping profitable growth as well as we're lowering the cost to fill an order, driving more efficiency through technology and continuing to see media revenue growth. So that's the only piece I think that I would reinforce.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kenneth Goldman: Hi, thank you. I'll take a shot here on next year. I know you're not in a position to really give numbers and I wouldn't ask about that now, but you did talk about hopefully having low single-digit sort of normal inflation next year. You highlighted a healthy amount of productivity you expected or expecting. But you also mentioned that maybe your unit growth right now is a little bit disappointing, and you'll surely be lapping some challenging fuel margins that I imagine you won't assume will recur. So, I'm just trying to get a sense if you have maybe sluggish units, fuel comps are tough, to get to your earnings growth algo for next year, do you theoretically have to find other drivers that are better than their algo to offset those headwinds? I just want to kind of get a sense of how to think about at least some initial headwinds and tailwinds into next year, if that all makes sense.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. As you mentioned, we'll definitely share a lot more color, as you might expect, when we get to March. I think as we think about the model and just taking a bigger picture step back, we certainly believe that we've, over the last few years, built a more diverse ecosystem as a company. So, of course, food-at-home is an important part of -- the sort of -- it drives the flywheel. But as you know, we've been continuing to grow our fuel business, continue to grow health and wellness this year even with the impact of Express Groups, and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. So, we look at it more as a journey and we do believe that as we're building the strength in that ecosystem, it creates the -- a new way to generate value for our shareholders over time as we've talked about at previous investor meetings. I mean, I think some of the points you've raised would certainly be the areas where we'll be focusing on. I don't think it's a different strategy for Kroger. It's how do we continue to drive that flywheel as we think about taking cost out of our business so that we can invest more in customers and associates, continuing to drive traffic so we can continue to grow the alternative profit businesses. And we do think there's opportunity for margin improvement to continue beyond 2023, because of the initiatives we're driving around sourcing, supply chain, alternative profit streams, et cetera. So, I think from our perspective, certainly, if you were in a period where you weren't seeing sales growth for a sustained period of time because our model is built on sales growth, we'd have to look at our cost base and we'll look at our cost base in certain areas to be more productive. But we still believe that food-at-home is -- will normalize in the typical pattern that we see of that sort of 1% to 2% inflation over time and sort of 2% to 3% food-at-home growth. And we think our model is really well set up to be able to drive growth within that framework.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ken. The only other thing I would add to Gary's comment is if you look at our seamless business, we would expect that to continue to make progress as well, as I mentioned earlier. Thanks, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As you talk to your processed food and CPG partners, what are they telling you about their desire to further raise prices into next year, given your expectation that there could be typical inflation across the assortments that would necessitate that [indiscernible] prices go up? And this is against the backdrop where volumes continue to go down, you're providing more support. Why are they not rolling back prices to try and drive volume? And as part of that, given that you used your P&L to fund promotions a bit more in the third quarter, is that a sign that you are running into the limitation of the vendors willing to provide support for you to do these promotions? Thank you very much.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael. If you look at overall, they say in economics, all short statements are wrong. And you have CPGs that are all over the board in terms of their approach. Some CPGs are very willing to give up tonnage. And if they are, Our Brands will stay -- will be there for a customer to give them incredible value. And what we find is when a customer tries Our Brands, our repeat rate is incredibly high because of the quality and the value for the money. If you look in the quarter, in terms of funding, it was really done by CPGs and us. And as I mentioned earlier, CPGs were more aggressive in funding some of the promotions in the third quarter than the second quarter, and would expect that to continue. We are seeing more CPGs worrying about their tonnage growth, and I think that's part of what's driving that willingness, too. So, I appreciate the question, and thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Good morning, Rodney and Gary. Thanks for taking our questions.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Kelly Bania: I wanted to go back to the comment about building a more diverse ecosystem and talk a little bit more about alternative profit growth. I think there was a comment that, that is still growing double digits, which I think would mean around $150 million to $200 million in incremental year-over-year profit. But maybe just wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on that if that's the right ballpark. And how many more years can this business continue to grow at double-digit rate into the coming years?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I don't know that Gary and I will want to give the specifics for '24 on the alt profit since we're still going through the process. But we would expect alt profit to be a meaningful contributor of growth next year. And that's really driven by two things. One is our continued growth in our digital business, which is supporting our media business growth. And we think we're just getting started on that. If you look in the media world, your competitors are Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and then a lot of other players. And one of the things that we think transparency is so important in being able to give people good data is we think that is incredibly helpful relative to the Googles and Metas and others. So, we see a long-term opportunity to continue to grow the business there. And the specifics, I don't know that we want to get there either. And if you look at some of the other alternative profit businesses, some of those, we have wide variance of performance within the company. So, part of that growth is just driven by taking best-in-class within our own company and growing that as well. So, Kelly, I appreciate the question. And thanks, everyone, for all the questions. And as always, I'd like to take a few moments to share some comments with our associates listening in. To start, I'd like to say a huge thank you for all the hard work that you've done to make the holidays be so memorable for our customers and what you will do for the -- following the rest of the holiday season to make it equally as memorable for customers. As you know, food plays an important part in any celebration, and it provides an opportunity for people to connect and people that we love, especially with them and sharing special moments. If you had a chance to see our holiday film, you saw that idea come to life. And if you haven't seen our holiday film, you can go to YouTube to look at the full film. And it really does recognize that food connects us all. And whether that's honoring family traditions or creating new family ones, I've just been so inspired to see how our associates and our customers on sharing their videos and the unique ways they celebrate the holidays. As I said before, thank you for everything you do to create special memories for our customers every single day. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-kroger-co-reports-q3-2023-earnings-highlights-digital-growth-and-upcoming-merger-3247841,"Dec 01, 2023","Kroger Co . recently held its third quarter 2023 earnings conference call, underlining the resilience of its business model amid a challenging operating environment. The company reported growth in its alternative profit businesses and a robust performance in its digital segment, marked by double-digit expansion in both pickup and delivery services. Kroger also updated on its proposed merger with Albertsons (NYSE:ACI), which is expected to close in early 2024.
Key takeaways from the call include:Kroger's digital sales grew by 11% in the quarter, contributing to the company's growth strategy and customer loyalty.The company achieved an 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share in Q3 and remains on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023.The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remained well below target.Kroger updated its full-year guidance to reflect near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation, expecting full-year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1%, and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion.Kroger is exiting the ghost kitchen business, but remains committed to the growth opportunity in food away-from-home.The proposed merger with Albertsons is on track to close in early 2024, with integration planning progressing well.During the call, Kroger executives emphasized the company's commitment to providing exceptional value to customers through lower prices, personalized promotions, and rewards. They also discussed their focus on delivering best-in-class fulfillment and improving customer experience metrics. Despite inflation declining in the quarter, impacting overall sales, units showed signs of improvement. The company made investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, partially funded by cost-saving initiatives.
Kroger Health exceeded internal goals for vaccinations administered in 2023, contributing to the company's profitable growth. The fuel team also exceeded expectations, with customers saving 14% more in rewards per fuel purchase compared to last year. The company ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for several stores.
Looking ahead, Kroger's CEO, Rodney McMullen, and CFO, Gary Millerchip, anticipate low single-digit inflation next year. They highlighted Kroger's diverse ecosystem, which includes fuel, health and wellness, and alternative profit streams, as a strong position for growth. McMullen also mentioned the company's focus on growing its digital and media businesses, seeing long-term opportunities in these areas.
In terms of competition and inflation, Kroger believes the grocery sector will remain competitive in the future, but they have confidence in their ability to navigate the environment. They mentioned that customers appreciate the stability of inflation and are willing to spend on delivery and membership fees.

Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Robert Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen, and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline our discussion topics this morning. I will begin by covering the current retail environment and how the strength of Kroger's value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then, Gary will cover our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons, before we open it up for questions. Now, turning to our third quarter. Kroger's third quarter results highlight the strength and diversity of our business model in a challenged operating environment. A strong fuel performance and growth in our alternative profit businesses supported continued adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth. As consumer spending tightens, we are focused on providing customers with exceptional value by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, personalized promotions and rewards. We are growing households and increasing loyalty, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Customers are managing many economic factors that are pressuring their spending, including higher interest rates, reduced savings, and fewer government benefits, including SNAP. Although inflation is decelerating, customers are still adjusting to the impacts from eight consecutive quarters of broad and significant inflation. During the quarter, Kroger grew higher income households once again as our attractive mix of quality, value and convenience continues to drive engagement. By buying larger packs, more fresh items and more premium Our Brands products, these households are more profitable. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are actively looking for value, and our budget-conscious customers are under more significant spending pressure. We are also looking for ways to support customers with additional value, including in-store displays with everyday staples at low price points. We've seen a great response from all customers to these offers. But engagement from our budget-conscious households has been especially strong. Customers purchasing these offer items are making more trips and buying more units, not only recognizing the value with these displays, but the value across the entire store. To help more customers manage their budget, we are only deepening our commitment to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Our personalized promotions are an increasingly critical way for customers to save on items that matter most to them. We are applying analytics to Kroger's unmatched purchase data to strike the right balance between the depth and breadth of promotions. To ensure customers were able to enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, for example, we created a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person, which represents a lower price than last year. We have a long history of delivering value to our customers by providing a broad assortment of fresh foods at low prices through our unique omnichannel shopping experience. We achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of total household growth and increased loyal households even faster, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Now, I'll provide more details about how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. Starting with seamless. [Technical Difficulty] Our digital business delivered a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses. Multiple tailwinds are driving our sales momentum, including growth in both households and visits. Our new two-hour pickup service available in more than one-third of our stores also contributed to our success in the quarter. To become the online food retailer of choice, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment. Our teams improved key customer experience metrics in pickup, increasing fill rates and reducing wait times during the quarter. This resulted in an improved net promoter scores. Our customer fulfillment centers again led our delivery growth, where we continue to rapidly increase households. Our delivery customers enjoy the convenience of on-time refrigerated delivery directly to their doorstep with zero compromise on freshness, quality, and value. Turning to personalization. Investments in our personalized capabilities ensure we are meeting elevated customer demand for savings and enables us to deploy promotional dollars more effectively. Digital offers have increased compared to last year and our personalization capabilities have resulted in even more significant increase in redemptions, driving loyalty and increasing digitally-engaged households this quarter by 13%. Digitally-engaged households are incredibly valuable to our model as they are more loyal, spend nearly 3 times more with us, and accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. Now, I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model supported earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Growth in alternative profit businesses remained strong in the third quarter with balanced growth across the portfolio. The strength of our seamless ecosystem and elevated digital engagement is having a flywheel effect, creating the traffic and the data needed to drive growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, a higher-margin profit stream. Recently, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of KPM. This quarter, KPM made an important step in its journey to become the most trusted and transparent media company. By activating ad buying platforms, we are offering more self-service solutions to meet clients where they are today, providing advertisers more direct access to custom Kroger audiences. This first iteration has already launched, and KPM expects to expand to other buying platforms in the future. These new innovative features will help accelerate KPM's impressive growth by allowing advertisers to reduce waste and enhance measurement tools. Kroger Health had a strong quarter that exceeded our internal expectations and helped drive sales and profit growth. Our decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our customers and shareholders. Our teams have done an excellent job retaining patients and utilizing our pharmacists' extra capacity to devote more time to patient care, including growing our number of vaccinations. Gary will provide more on the financial impact of this later. During the quarter, we continued to see rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs in our retail pharmacies. While the long-term impacts of these drugs on customer buying habits are unknown, Kroger's 'Food as Medicine' philosophy positions us well to support our customers' health and wellness goals. Our comprehensive approach includes healthcare services, professional dietitians, and proprietary tools like our nutrition rating app, OptUP, which are all designed to support healthy living and to do so holistically. While we pride ourselves on data and insights, the patient data in our pharmacy operations is separate from our customer loyalty data and is protected by privacy laws. We are committed to using our data in an appropriate manner while not jeopardizing customers' trust. For now, we have not seen any major macro shifts in customer eating habits or spending behaviors. Food trends are constantly evolving, and we are committed to offering products that meet our customers' needs. For customers looking to adopt healthier habits with or without the help of these drugs, we are well-positioned to provide important healthcare services and healthy food options. At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, and I'm so impressed by the many ways our associates bring this to life every day in the ways they support our customers and each other. We know when associates are connected to our purpose, they feel connected to Kroger. Our annual Kroger Wellness Festival is just one example of living our purpose. This festival is one of the nation's largest health and wellness events, showcasing more than a 150 experiences and food offerings. Sponsors and celebrities joined Kroger in hundreds of thousands of visitors to share our vision for better physical, mental, and emotional health for families. It was wonderful to see the level of support and participation in this important mission. Also this quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which highlighted Kroger's significant progress on our 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' journey to expand access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food, and to reduce waste, especially food waste, across our footprint. Since we launched 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' in 2017, Kroger has donated more than 3 billion meals to feed hungry families, including more than 1.3 billion to fight food insecurity and nearly 600 million pounds of surplus food to our food bank partners. I am so proud of our teams and their efforts to reach these incredible milestones. Our associates are the driving force behind our success by delivering an outstanding customer experience and helping make the holidays even more special for our customers. We facilitate this through our long-standing commitment to invest in associate wages and benefits and training tools to advance their career growth. Feed Your Future, our continuing education benefit, is one of the important ways we make Kroger a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. This benefit provides up to $21,000 lifeline, and it's helped almost 6,000 associates this year alone, with approximately 90% of these participants being hourly. Our focus on development is contributing to strong improvements in retention, which includes associate continuity and a more consistent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are allowing Kroger to navigate a challenged environment, characterized by tightening consumer spending and food-at-home disinflation. We achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% this quarter, while also providing greater value for our customers, higher wages for our associates, and investing in strategic initiatives that will support future growth. This was made possible by our teams delivering strong performances across our margin expansion initiatives, fuel, alternative profit businesses, and health and wellness. Our year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023, building on record results over the prior three years. I'll now provide more detail on our third quarter. Identical sales without fuel decreased 0.6%. Underlying growth would have been positive 1% adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first two quarters of the year, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel and a negative effect on the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall net effect on operating profit was slightly positive. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle the impact of Express Scripts at the start of the new calendar year. Turning back to identical sales without fuel. As Rodney shared earlier, our seamless ecosystem is a critical component of our growth strategy, building customer loyalty and fueling our alternative profit businesses. Digital sales were a highlight in the quarter, growing 11%. Our overall sales continue to be affected by industry-wide disinflation. Inflation ended quarter three in the low-single digits, approximately 270 basis points lower than the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw inflation decline at a slower pace, and we would expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining positive at the year-end. Encouragingly, units have shown signs of improvement as inflation has decelerated, and we have sequentially improved units for four straight quarters. However, unit growth rates have lagged the rate of inflation decline and have not improved at the pace we would have expected. As a team, we are laser-focused on returning to unit growth and expect improvement in volumes to continue for the balance of the year. Gross margin was 22% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel increased 3 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we increased investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, and we were able to successfully fund these investments by continuing to execute our long-term margin improvement plan, including Our Brands optimization, sourcing efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Shrink was a headwind to gross margin during the quarter, primarily due to the continued rise in industry-wide theft and organized retail crime. We are investing in initiatives to mitigate shrink and protect our associates and customers in our stores. Looking ahead, we would expect these same factors that influence gross margin in quarter three will drive a similar outcome for gross margin rate in the fourth quarter. During quarter three, we recorded a LIFO charge of $29 million compared to a charge of $152 million for the same quarter last year. This reduction was due to inflation returning to low-single digits compared to double-digit growth experienced last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 32 basis points excluding fuel and adjustment items. The increase in OG&A rate was driven by planned investments in associate wages and benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. During the quarter, we also made the decision to invest in a number of strategic initiatives that are expected to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Investments were partially offset by execution of cost saving initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. We are confident in our ability to effectively manage costs and continue to deliver savings by eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience. We continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities across the business and remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. In the fourth quarter, we would expect our OG&A rate to be relatively flat compared to last year. Kroger Health is an important component of our value creation model and is delivering profitable growth in 2023. During the quarter, the team exceeded our internal goal for the number of vaccinations administered, and the higher profit margins associated with these vaccines helped offset the negative impact on margin rate from growth in GLP-1 drugs. As Rodney shared earlier, we are excited about the momentum in health and wellness, and see significant potential for future profitable growth in this area of our business. Fuel is also a key part of our strategy and through our rewards program is another way that we deliver value for customers and increase loyalty. Our fuel team did an outstanding job delivering results that were ahead of expectations in the third quarter. Our customers saved 14% more in rewards per fuel purchase compared to last year, which led to gallon sales outpacing the industry. The average retail price of fuel was $3.77 this quarter versus $3.84 last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.57 this quarter versus $0.50 last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. Kroger has made substantial investments over the last five years in our associates, raising the average hourly wage by more than 33%. We remain committed to supporting our associates with sustainable investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that will, at the same time, allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities that we serve. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drug, Dallas Meat and four stores in Roundy's, in total covering more than 19,000 associates. We have now ratified all agreements that were scheduled for negotiation in 2023. Turning to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and the disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4, which remains well below our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.3 to 2.5. This positions us well to execute our financing strategy to close the proposed merger with Albertsons early in 2024 and then quickly return to within our target leverage range post-merger. As I wrap up my comments on the quarter, let me provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Today, we updated our full-year guidance to reflect the impact of near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation. We now expect full-year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1%, and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023. Our latest sales trends would put us on track to achieve the midpoint of our updated annual sales guidance range. Importantly, we would expect to exit quarter four with a stronger sales trend than our overall results for the quarter as we start to cycle the effect of Express Scripts in January. We believe we are well-positioned to navigate near-term headwinds and the strength we are seeing in our alternative profit businesses, health and wellness and fuel, combined with a lower expected LIFO charge, gives us the confidence to raise the lower-end of our full-year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance range. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 to $4.60. And looking forward, Kroger remains committed to delivering attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with  Albertsons Companies . As of November 15, 2023, Kroger certified substantial compliance with the second request issued by the FTC. We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction. This step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement, including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S is a well-qualified buyer who meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction and will ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger. Frontline (NYSE:FRO) associates will remain employed and existing collective bargaining agreements will continue. We have made a compelling case to both Kroger and Albertsons stakeholders. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for our customers by lowering prices beginning on day one, extends our commitment to associates by increasing wages and benefits, and deepens trust with our communities by keeping stores open to assure America has access to fresh and affordable food. In terms of integration planning, we are progressing well. Our integration teams have made significant progress toward our first goal, which is to ensure continuity for associates and customers at closing. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both organizations and how we'll be able to learn from each other to provide customers with an even stronger food retail experience and compete even more effectively against larger non-union operators in the future. In closing, Kroger delivered another quarter of solid results. We are demonstrating our ability to manage through a more challenged environment and remain committed to balancing our investments in our associates and in lower prices for our customers, while continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Dean Rosenblum of Bernstein. Dean, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dean Rosenblum: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Hey, my question is really about a debate regarding the gross profit and operating profit impact of increasing digital sales. I mean, online was -- digital sales were up 11% this quarter on a total comp, ex Express Scripts of 1%, which says it's growing share. Can you help us understand -- I know you think about it in terms of the whole digital ecosystem, including the alternative revenues. But in terms of the actual operating profit contribution from digital relative to the stores, can you help us understand how to think about that as that mix continues to increase?
Rodney McMullen: If you look currently, digital would not be as profitable as stores. We do believe over time, that will change, and we think that'll change by multiple things, the overall ecosystem. If you look at the pickup, we continue to make significant progress on reducing the cost to serve a customer on pickup. If you look at our sheds, we continue to make progress on our sheds to get them to where the profitability of the shed would be the same as the store. So, if you just step back, kind of, we view job one is make sure we don't lose the customer. And what we find is that customer over time will spend more with us when they're engaged with us through pickup, delivery, and in-store. And then, obviously, if you look at the incremental profitability that is making meaningful progress, and we also, when you include media as well, that's making progress. So, if you look initially, it is not as profitable, but we have every expectations over time that it will be.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, Rodney, maybe just to add, Dean, a couple of specific data points. Can you hear me okay?
Dean Rosenblum: Yeah, please.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Dean, I think we talked, Dean, before about, we sort of bucket our digital business into two areas, the sort of the business prior to launching our CFCs, which will be pickup and delivery through our third-party providers, and then our customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado (LON:OCDO). We've talked before about the pickup and delivery business sort of having a pass-through profitability rate on incremental sales of around 5% or mid-single-digit percent and the store being sort of north of 15%. And we talked a couple of years ago about being on a journey to improving that pass-through rate through some of the things that Rodney mentioned around improving mix, around improving media revenue per transaction, and then also lowering the cost to fill a digital order. We've made good progress on all three of those areas, and we would certainly see now sort of the digital pass-through profitability heading towards that double-digit rate sort of on that journey towards getting towards parity in terms of overall profitability. And then, the Ocado CFCs, we're really still very much in the early stages of that journey where the total investment is sort of starting to peak and we're starting to see tailwinds in that profitability as we start to achieve more scale in those facilities.
Dean Rosenblum: That's great. Thanks so much, Gary. My follow-up question is, you mentioned certifying the second request substantial completion on November 15th. That would suggest that the FTC now has 30 days to either make a decision or to extend the period. Do you have any sense right now as to whether we might expect some sort of an FTC decision or that the FTC is more likely to extend the time for that decision?
Rodney McMullen: Dean, it's a great question. And if you look as you -- in our prepared comments, we expect to close in early 2024 as we have all along. We continue to have a cooperative relationship with the FTC and other interested parties, and it's still too early in terms of specific dates. Thanks, Dean.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Kessler: Hi there. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks, guys. Maybe starting with the question on your inflation or deflation outlook for 2024, what your current expectation is? And what would need to happen in the backdrop for us to see either deflation or a return to more modest inflation? And in the event that we see deflation, is there a scenario in which you can hold or still expand margins, even in that kind of backdrop?
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, thanks for the question. As you know, we'll certainly provide a lot more specific details of our outlook for 2024 when we get to our quarter four earnings in March. And we're continuing, as I'm sure many are in the market, to look at all the data points we see both internally and externally. We're probably looking at some of the same data sources that you are from the top likes of USDA and other published sources. I think our view right now, we recognize we don't have the perfect crystal ball and we'll continue to watch and evaluate how we see the outlook for next year. But overall, most of the data that we're seeing would tend to point towards more of a typical year next year for food-at-home with food-at-home inflation being in the low single-digit range. We certainly think there are different scenarios that can play out. And of course, we'll look to adapt our model as we would need to, if those were the case, but that would be the data that we're watching. And we'll certainly provide more color when we get to the March earnings and talk specifically about our 2024 views.
Rodney McMullen: And one of the things that Gary always reminds me of, if you look over the last 50 years, there's only been two years out of the last 50 where it's been negative, where there's been actual deflation in a year. And as you know, we've been able to maintain and create strong business results in all environments, whether it's inflationary or deflationary, and you just manage accordingly.
Michael Kessler: Okay, great. And then, a quick follow-up on the fuel business, which had higher-than-expected profitability. So, can you talk about what drove that? And is there any interplay, I guess, between that business and the core supermarket business, if there's any balancing of the profitability dynamics and what you're able to earn to kind of manage the P&L? Or this is being managed separately and it just happened to come in a little stronger in Q3? Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, Gary mentioned it, but we're super proud of our fuel team and the partnership with all the divisions. We had a significant increase in the amount of fuel rewards that were issued, so we really look at leveraging both of the businesses to support each other. The other thing that the fuel team has done a nice job on is making sure from an efficiency standpoint on deliveries, on procurement and all the ingredients as well. So really proud of what they've done, but it really is we leverage both sides of the business to support each other and feel really good about where that business turned out. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Montani: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on two fronts. One was just if you could discuss the overall competitive backdrop? And then, secondly, we've heard a fair amount of promotions could uptick into next year. And I guess the question on that would be, what do you see in terms of vendor support versus you all having to fund that yourselves? And then, the follow-up was just OG&A dollar growth. Is there still potential for $1 billion cost-out into '24? And what kind of dollar growth should we look for underlying in the fourth quarter?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I'll answer the competitive backdrop and promotions, and if Gary wants to add anything, he can. And then, I'll let Gary ask about -- or answer the OG&A. If you look at overall, from a competitive standpoint, the market feels very similar than what it has been for a long time. If you look at the promotional activity, CPGs are increasing their funding on promotional. And I think there's two things driving that. One is CPG is not being satisfied with their tonnage so they're increasing the amount of support. The other thing for everyone is the supply chain constraints that would have been in place a year ago and two years ago is real getting back to normal. So, people are beginning to feel comfortable on promoting again, where the worst thing that could have happened is for us or for a CPG to promote something and then not have adequate supply. So, it really is behaviors getting back to pre-COVID. And even if you look at shopping during Thanksgiving, it was really more last minute, which really reflected, if you go back and look at pre COVID, it's kind of what it was, and people getting comfortable there will be products there when they go to buy it. So both great questions, but that's really what we're seeing right now. And Gary, on the OG&A.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Rodney. So, in OG&A, I'll just maybe take a step back as well and just mention a couple of points that I talked about in the third quarter. As we looked at the third quarter going into it, we would have expected OG&A to be a little bit lower as a rate. The things that were in the plan would have been the investments in average hourly rates and increasing wages for our associates in our stores and supply chain network and also the impact of ESI, and they were very much in line with what we expected. The real differences in the third quarter were that we did make some decisions during the quarter to make some strategic investments that we believe will help set up 2024 and beyond in terms of continued revenue growth, but also additional cost savings. So, as we look at the fourth quarter, we actually believe that the trends in average hourly rate will continue, and of course, Express Scripts will continue to be a factor. But outside of that, we'd expect OG&A to be relatively flat during the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still see both a sort of tailwind from initiatives that we've launched this year that will have a run rate benefit into next year. And we still see good line of sight to continued cost savings by leveraging technology and improving efficiency, driving continued improvement in cost to serve in digital and a number of areas of the business. So, we would remain confident that we see a good line of sight to continue to find that sort of 3% to 5% productivity improvements that we target to make sure we can continue to invest in our customers and continue to invest in our associates.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John, please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with, can you talk to -- if you think about the promotional basket, proactive versus reactive on your end, right, kind of is it -- would you say, I don't know, 80% proactive, 20% reactive? I don't know how you think about that. And then, on the reactive side, it would seem that those without a loyalty program would be at a disadvantage to you and that you can see what's going on in the market and possibly respond where yours is more stealth. Is that even remotely how you run the business, right, where you can respond to others based on what you see out there?
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, John, for the question. By far, the majority, and when I say majority would be almost all would be proactive versus reactive. Now, all our teams will check prices every single week and there'll be adjustments based on that. But by far, the majority of our discounts are proactive. And some of that is what you can see in an ad. A lot of that is the things that you've mentioned in terms of direct to individual household offers. It's one of the things that we believe the reason why our loyal households continue to grow and some of those aspects is once you become a Kroger shopper, you're getting those loyal customer mailings, which will allow you to stretch your budget more. And there's also personalized offers that you can go to look at coupons and download those, and there's significant increase in those. So, when you look at -- when you shop with us, obviously, we are a promotional merchant. But when you look at the rewards that we offer between fuel rewards and other rewards and our loyal customer mailings, our basket price overall is within less than cents of our biggest competitor. It's just we go to market and offer a little different way. But it is the reason why loyal shoppers are so important to us because that's the shopper that really gets the full value equation from us.
Gary Millerchip: Rodney, maybe the one thing I would add to John's question, too, the second part would be, I think, John, it's one of the reasons why we do have additional confidence in how we can navigate through the environment is that I think as a combination of our reward program and more customers engaging digitally post COVID, it really does create the ability to channel the dollars in a way that give the customer the most impact and most value while also being able to target it rather than having to sort of peanut butter spread it across in different directions. And I think it's a different dynamic now compared to maybe five, 10 years ago in the way that we're able to personalize that value and go to market.
Rodney McMullen: You've been -- you've followed us for a long time and you would have heard us use the word cherry-pickers and really what it is trying to make sure we do is to give value to customers that are loyal to us as opposed to somebody that's just shopping a discounted item that we're not making any money on.
John Heinbockel: And then maybe as a follow-up, so it sounds like volume is slightly -- is negative, right? I don't know if it's negative 1% or a little more than that, but volume is negative. Is that fair, low single-digit? When do you think that returns to positive territory? And is that solely driven -- if you looked at the budget-conscious customers, because I know a couple of quarters ago, you broke that out. Is that negativity largely driven by that cohort?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look, volume would be slightly negative. If you look, we -- our trends have improved for four quarters in a row from a trend standpoint. That would be largely driven by the value shopper or customers on a budget. And the half full and half empty, the half empty is obviously that's being driven by that customer. Some of that's driven because of the impact from inflation. Part of it's -- or SNAP is down about 30%. The full part is the customers that are loyal, we're continuing to grow with that customer and that customer's profitability is meaningfully better than the value shopper. Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank. Krisztina, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Krisztina Katai: Hi, good morning. So Rodney, I wanted to ask you just a conceptual question on grocery sector and the level of competition, right? Because if we're thinking about it, why wouldn't the sector be more competitive as we head into 2024? The consumer remains under pressure. Some of the low end is under increased pressure. CPGs are raising their support, volumes continue to lag. So that is question one, just conceptually, why wouldn't that be the case? And secondly, how is Kroger positioned in a potentially no inflation to even deflationary backdrop relative to the base case of a normal food-at-home year of low single-digit inflation?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look at, one of the things that makes this industry a lot of fun is we always assume that the business will continue to be more competitive. And if you look at our fundamental business model over the last five years or 10 years or 15 years, every year, we assume that it's going to be more competitive. We worked really hard to identify process changes and cost reductions so that we can continue to fund wage increases and invest in lowering prices for the customer. So, when we look at 2024, and obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail early next year when we give guidance, but right now, we don't see that environment any different than what we would have felt for the last five years or 10 years or 15 years. And the positive is customers get a better value every year and they get a better experience every year. And when you look at for us, one of the things that we think is important for the customers, the customer doesn't have to compromise. So, they get amazing fresh product that will last a long time when they get at home, with amazing friendly associates, with the smile and support that everything in their basket plus a little bit an extra piece of cheese or something they've engaged with Murray, so -- and not have to compromise from a pricing standpoint. So, when you look overall, we feel very good in terms of how we're positioned with the customers that really appreciate what we offer.
Gary Millerchip: Maybe, Rodney, one thing I would just add, too, Krisztina, specific to 2024, a couple of things for Kroger that we think are helpful as we look into next year. One is, of course, that we're cycling the impact of Express Scripts when we get to January and we'll start to see that flow through in the early periods of the year. And then secondly, one of the things that we've seen, as we look at 2023, many states, as you know, reduced the amount of SNAP dollars that were available in the market, and those happened sort of around the middle part of our Q1 last year or this year, I should say. What we've seen in one or two markets where we're cycling those earlier markets where they reduced the SNAP dollars, it certainly starts to create a bit of a different trend in the growth in those markets, too. So, we do think there's, for the industry and specifically for the markets that we operate in, as you start to cycle the impact of those SNAP dollars, which perhaps had a bit more of an impact than we were originally thinking they might across the industry, that starts to create some, I think, tailwind in the industry towards next year's growth as well.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Krisztina.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Ed, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ed Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Ed Kelly: Gary, I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. I think you said that the Q4 gross margin, you expect to be flattish. If you could just confirm that. And then looking out, is the base case for '24 that, that flattish trend would continue? And then, within that context, I'm curious about shrink. And maybe just educate us a little bit on when you do your accounts, the visibility you have on where you stand in shrink, and do you believe it's peaked?
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Ed. So, the first part of the question, yes, you're essentially right that we -- I said in my prepared comments that we would expect Q4 to look very similar to Q3. The way that I sort of would break that down is that we've been equally as pleased with the progress that we've seen in the margin improvement plan initiatives that we saw in the earlier part of the year as well. So, we continue to see strong benefits from Our Brands, strong benefits from sourcing, health and wellness, of course, with Express Scripts is a tailwind this year to gross margin, and supply chain and alternative profits. All those areas continue to generate tailwinds in our gross margin rate. What we did in the third quarter is we did invest more in gross margin to balance those benefits partly in increased pricing and promotion, as Rodney mentioned earlier. And we did also increase advertising costs during the quarter as well. So, those would have been the differences quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we saw and what we would expect to continue to be a similar pattern as we think about the fourth quarter. I'd say as we look into beyond 2023, we certainly still see a lot of potential for the tailwinds that I mentioned around Our Brands sourcing, these areas where we believe that we are on a multiyear path to continue to drive improvement and drive growth. And of course, alternative profit streams continues to grow at a double-digit pace off a bigger base as well. So, I think we still have a lot of confidence in those levers. And what we're doing is making sure we're balancing the business to set ourselves up for continued sustained growth in the future. From a shrink perspective, we would still see shrink as a headwind, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I would say, it's probably somewhat less dramatic for us than maybe some of our peer group because while we have a general merchandise business that's impacted, it's less impacted than probably some of the big-box retailers, but it would still be a headwind to our gross margin rate that would have impacted the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. That headwind actually would have been less than it was in the second quarter, not dramatically, but it would have eased somewhat. So, it's still something that we have to work through and continue to offset, but we are seeing at least the trend in terms of year-over-year growth decelerate, but it would still be a headwind today because of the crime and organized retail crime factors I mentioned earlier.
Rodney McMullen: The other thing I think is important to remember is a lot of our shrink is in our fresh departments. And our fresh departments, actually, a lot of that is, you can manage it by changing processes and using technology. And our teams have done a great job actually on improving shrink in the fresh departments because of our store teams partnering with warehouse teams on processes and leveraging technology as well, and I think as a big chunk of the trend -- slight trend improvements that Gary mentioned.
Ed Kelly: Great point.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky: Rodney, could you talk a little bit about the economy's effect and inflation on your digital business, and I'm thinking particularly about customers' willingness to spend money on any delivery fees or membership fees, and also how the economy might be impacting delivery volumes and digital order volumes?
Rodney McMullen: If you look at overall -- thanks, Chuck. If you look at overall, inflation is definitely stabilizing overall. And it's -- from a customer standpoint, they appreciate the stabilization but they also know the fact that if you look at over the last two years, they've had to endure a lot of inflation. And if you look at some of the fresh departments, some of that has actually returned back to normal. But if you look at on the process side, you wouldn't see that. So, if you look at like eggs, for an example, eggs are significantly deflationary. And we'll all be happy when we get to the point where we're cycling that early next year or next year. If you look at customer behavior, it's fascinating. Customers do a lot of work to save where they want to save or feel like they need to save, so in pack size, if you look at moving to Our Brands versus some of the national brands. But if you look at membership fees and delivery fees and things like that, that business continues to grow strongly. And in fact, it was up double digits and that's what drove the 11%. I'm sure part of that, and any time I talk to a politician, I always remind them, if you look at customers on a budget, they're under a lot of strain and they're doing a lot of behavior changes. If you look at customers that are not as focused on price because inflation hasn't affected them as much, that customers' behavior is still very strong, and they're still continuing to buy big packs, continuing to buy nicer wines, Murray's Cheese, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), things like that. So, we over-index with our membership program on customers that are more mainstream and upscale, so I'm sure that's part of the reason why we're not seeing the behavior change.
Chuck Cerankosky: Okay. Thanks for that. And just real quick, you're exiting the ghost kitchen business. Any particular reason for that?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, great question. Appreciate it. We test a lot of different things, and we'll move on to the next version of it. We still think food away-from-home is a huge growth opportunity for us and we'll continue to focus on it. The ghost kitchen, the few customers that used it, loved it, but it just wasn't enough. So, it's one of those things where you move on. So thanks, Chuck.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to Kroger's digital performance, another quarter of double-digit growth. Did anything surprise you on the digital front? And just any more color in terms of what you guys are seeing delivery versus pickup?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I'll start and let Gary finish. I wouldn't call it a surprise, but it's great to see that the NPS scores, both in terms of our year-on-year from a pickup standpoint and a delivery standpoint is very strong. If you look at our shed delivery business, the repeat rate continues to be strong. So it really is the customers really appreciate that white-glove experience. So, I don't want to make it sound like we're surprised by it, but it's nice to see what we thought play out. Gary, I'll let you...
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, I think you said it well, Rodney. I think the only thing I would add, Rupesh, is that we've said before, we believe that digital is a growth engine for the company. And I think everything we continue to see gives us that belief it will continue to be an opportunity to drive deeper customer engagement and growth. And I mentioned in a comment earlier, but the thing we didn't talk about in the script was we are seeing continued improvement in profitability. So, it's helping profitable growth as well as we're lowering the cost to fill an order, driving more efficiency through technology and continuing to see media revenue growth. So that's the only piece I think that I would reinforce.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kenneth Goldman: Hi, thank you. I'll take a shot here on next year. I know you're not in a position to really give numbers and I wouldn't ask about that now, but you did talk about hopefully having low single-digit sort of normal inflation next year. You highlighted a healthy amount of productivity you expected or expecting. But you also mentioned that maybe your unit growth right now is a little bit disappointing, and you'll surely be lapping some challenging fuel margins that I imagine you won't assume will recur. So, I'm just trying to get a sense if you have maybe sluggish units, fuel comps are tough, to get to your earnings growth algo for next year, do you theoretically have to find other drivers that are better than their algo to offset those headwinds? I just want to kind of get a sense of how to think about at least some initial headwinds and tailwinds into next year, if that all makes sense.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. As you mentioned, we'll definitely share a lot more color, as you might expect, when we get to March. I think as we think about the model and just taking a bigger picture step back, we certainly believe that we've, over the last few years, built a more diverse ecosystem as a company. So, of course, food-at-home is an important part of -- the sort of -- it drives the flywheel. But as you know, we've been continuing to grow our fuel business, continue to grow health and wellness this year even with the impact of Express Groups, and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. So, we look at it more as a journey and we do believe that as we're building the strength in that ecosystem, it creates the -- a new way to generate value for our shareholders over time as we've talked about at previous investor meetings. I mean, I think some of the points you've raised would certainly be the areas where we'll be focusing on. I don't think it's a different strategy for Kroger. It's how do we continue to drive that flywheel as we think about taking cost out of our business so that we can invest more in customers and associates, continuing to drive traffic so we can continue to grow the alternative profit businesses. And we do think there's opportunity for margin improvement to continue beyond 2023, because of the initiatives we're driving around sourcing, supply chain, alternative profit streams, et cetera. So, I think from our perspective, certainly, if you were in a period where you weren't seeing sales growth for a sustained period of time because our model is built on sales growth, we'd have to look at our cost base and we'll look at our cost base in certain areas to be more productive. But we still believe that food-at-home is -- will normalize in the typical pattern that we see of that sort of 1% to 2% inflation over time and sort of 2% to 3% food-at-home growth. And we think our model is really well set up to be able to drive growth within that framework.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ken. The only other thing I would add to Gary's comment is if you look at our seamless business, we would expect that to continue to make progress as well, as I mentioned earlier. Thanks, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As you talk to your processed food and CPG partners, what are they telling you about their desire to further raise prices into next year, given your expectation that there could be typical inflation across the assortments that would necessitate that [indiscernible] prices go up? And this is against the backdrop where volumes continue to go down, you're providing more support. Why are they not rolling back prices to try and drive volume? And as part of that, given that you used your P&L to fund promotions a bit more in the third quarter, is that a sign that you are running into the limitation of the vendors willing to provide support for you to do these promotions? Thank you very much.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael. If you look at overall, they say in economics, all short statements are wrong. And you have CPGs that are all over the board in terms of their approach. Some CPGs are very willing to give up tonnage. And if they are, Our Brands will stay -- will be there for a customer to give them incredible value. And what we find is when a customer tries Our Brands, our repeat rate is incredibly high because of the quality and the value for the money. If you look in the quarter, in terms of funding, it was really done by CPGs and us. And as I mentioned earlier, CPGs were more aggressive in funding some of the promotions in the third quarter than the second quarter, and would expect that to continue. We are seeing more CPGs worrying about their tonnage growth, and I think that's part of what's driving that willingness, too. So, I appreciate the question, and thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Good morning, Rodney and Gary. Thanks for taking our questions.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Kelly Bania: I wanted to go back to the comment about building a more diverse ecosystem and talk a little bit more about alternative profit growth. I think there was a comment that, that is still growing double digits, which I think would mean around $150 million to $200 million in incremental year-over-year profit. But maybe just wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on that if that's the right ballpark. And how many more years can this business continue to grow at double-digit rate into the coming years?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I don't know that Gary and I will want to give the specifics for '24 on the alt profit since we're still going through the process. But we would expect alt profit to be a meaningful contributor of growth next year. And that's really driven by two things. One is our continued growth in our digital business, which is supporting our media business growth. And we think we're just getting started on that. If you look in the media world, your competitors are Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and then a lot of other players. And one of the things that we think transparency is so important in being able to give people good data is we think that is incredibly helpful relative to the Googles and Metas and others. So, we see a long-term opportunity to continue to grow the business there. And the specifics, I don't know that we want to get there either. And if you look at some of the other alternative profit businesses, some of those, we have wide variance of performance within the company. So, part of that growth is just driven by taking best-in-class within our own company and growing that as well. So, Kelly, I appreciate the question. And thanks, everyone, for all the questions. And as always, I'd like to take a few moments to share some comments with our associates listening in. To start, I'd like to say a huge thank you for all the hard work that you've done to make the holidays be so memorable for our customers and what you will do for the -- following the rest of the holiday season to make it equally as memorable for customers. As you know, food plays an important part in any celebration, and it provides an opportunity for people to connect and people that we love, especially with them and sharing special moments. If you had a chance to see our holiday film, you saw that idea come to life. And if you haven't seen our holiday film, you can go to YouTube to look at the full film. And it really does recognize that food connects us all. And whether that's honoring family traditions or creating new family ones, I've just been so inspired to see how our associates and our customers on sharing their videos and the unique ways they celebrate the holidays. As I said before, thank you for everything you do to create special memories for our customers every single day. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Robert Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen, and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline our discussion topics this morning. I will begin by covering the current retail environment and how the strength of Kroger's value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then, Gary will cover our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons, before we open it up for questions. Now, turning to our third quarter. Kroger's third quarter results highlight the strength and diversity of our business model in a challenged operating environment. A strong fuel performance and growth in our alternative profit businesses supported continued adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth. As consumer spending tightens, we are focused on providing customers with exceptional value by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, personalized promotions and rewards. We are growing households and increasing loyalty, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Customers are managing many economic factors that are pressuring their spending, including higher interest rates, reduced savings, and fewer government benefits, including SNAP. Although inflation is decelerating, customers are still adjusting to the impacts from eight consecutive quarters of broad and significant inflation. During the quarter, Kroger grew higher income households once again as our attractive mix of quality, value and convenience continues to drive engagement. By buying larger packs, more fresh items and more premium Our Brands products, these households are more profitable. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are actively looking for value, and our budget-conscious customers are under more significant spending pressure. We are also looking for ways to support customers with additional value, including in-store displays with everyday staples at low price points. We've seen a great response from all customers to these offers. But engagement from our budget-conscious households has been especially strong. Customers purchasing these offer items are making more trips and buying more units, not only recognizing the value with these displays, but the value across the entire store. To help more customers manage their budget, we are only deepening our commitment to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Our personalized promotions are an increasingly critical way for customers to save on items that matter most to them. We are applying analytics to Kroger's unmatched purchase data to strike the right balance between the depth and breadth of promotions. To ensure customers were able to enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, for example, we created a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person, which represents a lower price than last year. We have a long history of delivering value to our customers by providing a broad assortment of fresh foods at low prices through our unique omnichannel shopping experience. We achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of total household growth and increased loyal households even faster, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Now, I'll provide more details about how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. Starting with seamless. [Technical Difficulty] Our digital business delivered a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses. Multiple tailwinds are driving our sales momentum, including growth in both households and visits. Our new two-hour pickup service available in more than one-third of our stores also contributed to our success in the quarter. To become the online food retailer of choice, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment. Our teams improved key customer experience metrics in pickup, increasing fill rates and reducing wait times during the quarter. This resulted in an improved net promoter scores. Our customer fulfillment centers again led our delivery growth, where we continue to rapidly increase households. Our delivery customers enjoy the convenience of on-time refrigerated delivery directly to their doorstep with zero compromise on freshness, quality, and value. Turning to personalization. Investments in our personalized capabilities ensure we are meeting elevated customer demand for savings and enables us to deploy promotional dollars more effectively. Digital offers have increased compared to last year and our personalization capabilities have resulted in even more significant increase in redemptions, driving loyalty and increasing digitally-engaged households this quarter by 13%. Digitally-engaged households are incredibly valuable to our model as they are more loyal, spend nearly 3 times more with us, and accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. Now, I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model supported earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Growth in alternative profit businesses remained strong in the third quarter with balanced growth across the portfolio. The strength of our seamless ecosystem and elevated digital engagement is having a flywheel effect, creating the traffic and the data needed to drive growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, a higher-margin profit stream. Recently, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of KPM. This quarter, KPM made an important step in its journey to become the most trusted and transparent media company. By activating ad buying platforms, we are offering more self-service solutions to meet clients where they are today, providing advertisers more direct access to custom Kroger audiences. This first iteration has already launched, and KPM expects to expand to other buying platforms in the future. These new innovative features will help accelerate KPM's impressive growth by allowing advertisers to reduce waste and enhance measurement tools. Kroger Health had a strong quarter that exceeded our internal expectations and helped drive sales and profit growth. Our decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our customers and shareholders. Our teams have done an excellent job retaining patients and utilizing our pharmacists' extra capacity to devote more time to patient care, including growing our number of vaccinations. Gary will provide more on the financial impact of this later. During the quarter, we continued to see rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs in our retail pharmacies. While the long-term impacts of these drugs on customer buying habits are unknown, Kroger's 'Food as Medicine' philosophy positions us well to support our customers' health and wellness goals. Our comprehensive approach includes healthcare services, professional dietitians, and proprietary tools like our nutrition rating app, OptUP, which are all designed to support healthy living and to do so holistically. While we pride ourselves on data and insights, the patient data in our pharmacy operations is separate from our customer loyalty data and is protected by privacy laws. We are committed to using our data in an appropriate manner while not jeopardizing customers' trust. For now, we have not seen any major macro shifts in customer eating habits or spending behaviors. Food trends are constantly evolving, and we are committed to offering products that meet our customers' needs. For customers looking to adopt healthier habits with or without the help of these drugs, we are well-positioned to provide important healthcare services and healthy food options. At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, and I'm so impressed by the many ways our associates bring this to life every day in the ways they support our customers and each other. We know when associates are connected to our purpose, they feel connected to Kroger. Our annual Kroger Wellness Festival is just one example of living our purpose. This festival is one of the nation's largest health and wellness events, showcasing more than a 150 experiences and food offerings. Sponsors and celebrities joined Kroger in hundreds of thousands of visitors to share our vision for better physical, mental, and emotional health for families. It was wonderful to see the level of support and participation in this important mission. Also this quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which highlighted Kroger's significant progress on our 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' journey to expand access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food, and to reduce waste, especially food waste, across our footprint. Since we launched 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' in 2017, Kroger has donated more than 3 billion meals to feed hungry families, including more than 1.3 billion to fight food insecurity and nearly 600 million pounds of surplus food to our food bank partners. I am so proud of our teams and their efforts to reach these incredible milestones. Our associates are the driving force behind our success by delivering an outstanding customer experience and helping make the holidays even more special for our customers. We facilitate this through our long-standing commitment to invest in associate wages and benefits and training tools to advance their career growth. Feed Your Future, our continuing education benefit, is one of the important ways we make Kroger a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. This benefit provides up to $21,000 lifeline, and it's helped almost 6,000 associates this year alone, with approximately 90% of these participants being hourly. Our focus on development is contributing to strong improvements in retention, which includes associate continuity and a more consistent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are allowing Kroger to navigate a challenged environment, characterized by tightening consumer spending and food-at-home disinflation. We achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% this quarter, while also providing greater value for our customers, higher wages for our associates, and investing in strategic initiatives that will support future growth. This was made possible by our teams delivering strong performances across our margin expansion initiatives, fuel, alternative profit businesses, and health and wellness. Our year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023, building on record results over the prior three years. I'll now provide more detail on our third quarter. Identical sales without fuel decreased 0.6%. Underlying growth would have been positive 1% adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first two quarters of the year, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel and a negative effect on the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall net effect on operating profit was slightly positive. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle the impact of Express Scripts at the start of the new calendar year. Turning back to identical sales without fuel. As Rodney shared earlier, our seamless ecosystem is a critical component of our growth strategy, building customer loyalty and fueling our alternative profit businesses. Digital sales were a highlight in the quarter, growing 11%. Our overall sales continue to be affected by industry-wide disinflation. Inflation ended quarter three in the low-single digits, approximately 270 basis points lower than the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw inflation decline at a slower pace, and we would expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining positive at the year-end. Encouragingly, units have shown signs of improvement as inflation has decelerated, and we have sequentially improved units for four straight quarters. However, unit growth rates have lagged the rate of inflation decline and have not improved at the pace we would have expected. As a team, we are laser-focused on returning to unit growth and expect improvement in volumes to continue for the balance of the year. Gross margin was 22% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel increased 3 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we increased investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, and we were able to successfully fund these investments by continuing to execute our long-term margin improvement plan, including Our Brands optimization, sourcing efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Shrink was a headwind to gross margin during the quarter, primarily due to the continued rise in industry-wide theft and organized retail crime. We are investing in initiatives to mitigate shrink and protect our associates and customers in our stores. Looking ahead, we would expect these same factors that influence gross margin in quarter three will drive a similar outcome for gross margin rate in the fourth quarter. During quarter three, we recorded a LIFO charge of $29 million compared to a charge of $152 million for the same quarter last year. This reduction was due to inflation returning to low-single digits compared to double-digit growth experienced last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 32 basis points excluding fuel and adjustment items. The increase in OG&A rate was driven by planned investments in associate wages and benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. During the quarter, we also made the decision to invest in a number of strategic initiatives that are expected to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Investments were partially offset by execution of cost saving initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. We are confident in our ability to effectively manage costs and continue to deliver savings by eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience. We continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities across the business and remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. In the fourth quarter, we would expect our OG&A rate to be relatively flat compared to last year. Kroger Health is an important component of our value creation model and is delivering profitable growth in 2023. During the quarter, the team exceeded our internal goal for the number of vaccinations administered, and the higher profit margins associated with these vaccines helped offset the negative impact on margin rate from growth in GLP-1 drugs. As Rodney shared earlier, we are excited about the momentum in health and wellness, and see significant potential for future profitable growth in this area of our business. Fuel is also a key part of our strategy and through our rewards program is another way that we deliver value for customers and increase loyalty. Our fuel team did an outstanding job delivering results that were ahead of expectations in the third quarter. Our customers saved 14% more in rewards per fuel purchase compared to last year, which led to gallon sales outpacing the industry. The average retail price of fuel was $3.77 this quarter versus $3.84 last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.57 this quarter versus $0.50 last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. Kroger has made substantial investments over the last five years in our associates, raising the average hourly wage by more than 33%. We remain committed to supporting our associates with sustainable investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that will, at the same time, allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities that we serve. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drug, Dallas Meat and four stores in Roundy's, in total covering more than 19,000 associates. We have now ratified all agreements that were scheduled for negotiation in 2023. Turning to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and the disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4, which remains well below our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.3 to 2.5. This positions us well to execute our financing strategy to close the proposed merger with Albertsons early in 2024 and then quickly return to within our target leverage range post-merger. As I wrap up my comments on the quarter, let me provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Today, we updated our full-year guidance to reflect the impact of near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation. We now expect full-year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1%, and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023. Our latest sales trends would put us on track to achieve the midpoint of our updated annual sales guidance range. Importantly, we would expect to exit quarter four with a stronger sales trend than our overall results for the quarter as we start to cycle the effect of Express Scripts in January. We believe we are well-positioned to navigate near-term headwinds and the strength we are seeing in our alternative profit businesses, health and wellness and fuel, combined with a lower expected LIFO charge, gives us the confidence to raise the lower-end of our full-year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance range. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 to $4.60. And looking forward, Kroger remains committed to delivering attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with  Albertsons Companies . As of November 15, 2023, Kroger certified substantial compliance with the second request issued by the FTC. We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction. This step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement, including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S is a well-qualified buyer who meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction and will ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger. Frontline (NYSE:FRO) associates will remain employed and existing collective bargaining agreements will continue. We have made a compelling case to both Kroger and Albertsons stakeholders. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for our customers by lowering prices beginning on day one, extends our commitment to associates by increasing wages and benefits, and deepens trust with our communities by keeping stores open to assure America has access to fresh and affordable food. In terms of integration planning, we are progressing well. Our integration teams have made significant progress toward our first goal, which is to ensure continuity for associates and customers at closing. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both organizations and how we'll be able to learn from each other to provide customers with an even stronger food retail experience and compete even more effectively against larger non-union operators in the future. In closing, Kroger delivered another quarter of solid results. We are demonstrating our ability to manage through a more challenged environment and remain committed to balancing our investments in our associates and in lower prices for our customers, while continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Dean Rosenblum of Bernstein. Dean, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dean Rosenblum: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Hey, my question is really about a debate regarding the gross profit and operating profit impact of increasing digital sales. I mean, online was -- digital sales were up 11% this quarter on a total comp, ex Express Scripts of 1%, which says it's growing share. Can you help us understand -- I know you think about it in terms of the whole digital ecosystem, including the alternative revenues. But in terms of the actual operating profit contribution from digital relative to the stores, can you help us understand how to think about that as that mix continues to increase?
Rodney McMullen: If you look currently, digital would not be as profitable as stores. We do believe over time, that will change, and we think that'll change by multiple things, the overall ecosystem. If you look at the pickup, we continue to make significant progress on reducing the cost to serve a customer on pickup. If you look at our sheds, we continue to make progress on our sheds to get them to where the profitability of the shed would be the same as the store. So, if you just step back, kind of, we view job one is make sure we don't lose the customer. And what we find is that customer over time will spend more with us when they're engaged with us through pickup, delivery, and in-store. And then, obviously, if you look at the incremental profitability that is making meaningful progress, and we also, when you include media as well, that's making progress. So, if you look initially, it is not as profitable, but we have every expectations over time that it will be.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, Rodney, maybe just to add, Dean, a couple of specific data points. Can you hear me okay?
Dean Rosenblum: Yeah, please.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Dean, I think we talked, Dean, before about, we sort of bucket our digital business into two areas, the sort of the business prior to launching our CFCs, which will be pickup and delivery through our third-party providers, and then our customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado (LON:OCDO). We've talked before about the pickup and delivery business sort of having a pass-through profitability rate on incremental sales of around 5% or mid-single-digit percent and the store being sort of north of 15%. And we talked a couple of years ago about being on a journey to improving that pass-through rate through some of the things that Rodney mentioned around improving mix, around improving media revenue per transaction, and then also lowering the cost to fill a digital order. We've made good progress on all three of those areas, and we would certainly see now sort of the digital pass-through profitability heading towards that double-digit rate sort of on that journey towards getting towards parity in terms of overall profitability. And then, the Ocado CFCs, we're really still very much in the early stages of that journey where the total investment is sort of starting to peak and we're starting to see tailwinds in that profitability as we start to achieve more scale in those facilities.
Dean Rosenblum: That's great. Thanks so much, Gary. My follow-up question is, you mentioned certifying the second request substantial completion on November 15th. That would suggest that the FTC now has 30 days to either make a decision or to extend the period. Do you have any sense right now as to whether we might expect some sort of an FTC decision or that the FTC is more likely to extend the time for that decision?
Rodney McMullen: Dean, it's a great question. And if you look as you -- in our prepared comments, we expect to close in early 2024 as we have all along. We continue to have a cooperative relationship with the FTC and other interested parties, and it's still too early in terms of specific dates. Thanks, Dean.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Kessler: Hi there. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks, guys. Maybe starting with the question on your inflation or deflation outlook for 2024, what your current expectation is? And what would need to happen in the backdrop for us to see either deflation or a return to more modest inflation? And in the event that we see deflation, is there a scenario in which you can hold or still expand margins, even in that kind of backdrop?
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, thanks for the question. As you know, we'll certainly provide a lot more specific details of our outlook for 2024 when we get to our quarter four earnings in March. And we're continuing, as I'm sure many are in the market, to look at all the data points we see both internally and externally. We're probably looking at some of the same data sources that you are from the top likes of USDA and other published sources. I think our view right now, we recognize we don't have the perfect crystal ball and we'll continue to watch and evaluate how we see the outlook for next year. But overall, most of the data that we're seeing would tend to point towards more of a typical year next year for food-at-home with food-at-home inflation being in the low single-digit range. We certainly think there are different scenarios that can play out. And of course, we'll look to adapt our model as we would need to, if those were the case, but that would be the data that we're watching. And we'll certainly provide more color when we get to the March earnings and talk specifically about our 2024 views.
Rodney McMullen: And one of the things that Gary always reminds me of, if you look over the last 50 years, there's only been two years out of the last 50 where it's been negative, where there's been actual deflation in a year. And as you know, we've been able to maintain and create strong business results in all environments, whether it's inflationary or deflationary, and you just manage accordingly.
Michael Kessler: Okay, great. And then, a quick follow-up on the fuel business, which had higher-than-expected profitability. So, can you talk about what drove that? And is there any interplay, I guess, between that business and the core supermarket business, if there's any balancing of the profitability dynamics and what you're able to earn to kind of manage the P&L? Or this is being managed separately and it just happened to come in a little stronger in Q3? Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, Gary mentioned it, but we're super proud of our fuel team and the partnership with all the divisions. We had a significant increase in the amount of fuel rewards that were issued, so we really look at leveraging both of the businesses to support each other. The other thing that the fuel team has done a nice job on is making sure from an efficiency standpoint on deliveries, on procurement and all the ingredients as well. So really proud of what they've done, but it really is we leverage both sides of the business to support each other and feel really good about where that business turned out. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Montani: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on two fronts. One was just if you could discuss the overall competitive backdrop? And then, secondly, we've heard a fair amount of promotions could uptick into next year. And I guess the question on that would be, what do you see in terms of vendor support versus you all having to fund that yourselves? And then, the follow-up was just OG&A dollar growth. Is there still potential for $1 billion cost-out into '24? And what kind of dollar growth should we look for underlying in the fourth quarter?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I'll answer the competitive backdrop and promotions, and if Gary wants to add anything, he can. And then, I'll let Gary ask about -- or answer the OG&A. If you look at overall, from a competitive standpoint, the market feels very similar than what it has been for a long time. If you look at the promotional activity, CPGs are increasing their funding on promotional. And I think there's two things driving that. One is CPG is not being satisfied with their tonnage so they're increasing the amount of support. The other thing for everyone is the supply chain constraints that would have been in place a year ago and two years ago is real getting back to normal. So, people are beginning to feel comfortable on promoting again, where the worst thing that could have happened is for us or for a CPG to promote something and then not have adequate supply. So, it really is behaviors getting back to pre-COVID. And even if you look at shopping during Thanksgiving, it was really more last minute, which really reflected, if you go back and look at pre COVID, it's kind of what it was, and people getting comfortable there will be products there when they go to buy it. So both great questions, but that's really what we're seeing right now. And Gary, on the OG&A.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Rodney. So, in OG&A, I'll just maybe take a step back as well and just mention a couple of points that I talked about in the third quarter. As we looked at the third quarter going into it, we would have expected OG&A to be a little bit lower as a rate. The things that were in the plan would have been the investments in average hourly rates and increasing wages for our associates in our stores and supply chain network and also the impact of ESI, and they were very much in line with what we expected. The real differences in the third quarter were that we did make some decisions during the quarter to make some strategic investments that we believe will help set up 2024 and beyond in terms of continued revenue growth, but also additional cost savings. So, as we look at the fourth quarter, we actually believe that the trends in average hourly rate will continue, and of course, Express Scripts will continue to be a factor. But outside of that, we'd expect OG&A to be relatively flat during the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still see both a sort of tailwind from initiatives that we've launched this year that will have a run rate benefit into next year. And we still see good line of sight to continued cost savings by leveraging technology and improving efficiency, driving continued improvement in cost to serve in digital and a number of areas of the business. So, we would remain confident that we see a good line of sight to continue to find that sort of 3% to 5% productivity improvements that we target to make sure we can continue to invest in our customers and continue to invest in our associates.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John, please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with, can you talk to -- if you think about the promotional basket, proactive versus reactive on your end, right, kind of is it -- would you say, I don't know, 80% proactive, 20% reactive? I don't know how you think about that. And then, on the reactive side, it would seem that those without a loyalty program would be at a disadvantage to you and that you can see what's going on in the market and possibly respond where yours is more stealth. Is that even remotely how you run the business, right, where you can respond to others based on what you see out there?
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, John, for the question. By far, the majority, and when I say majority would be almost all would be proactive versus reactive. Now, all our teams will check prices every single week and there'll be adjustments based on that. But by far, the majority of our discounts are proactive. And some of that is what you can see in an ad. A lot of that is the things that you've mentioned in terms of direct to individual household offers. It's one of the things that we believe the reason why our loyal households continue to grow and some of those aspects is once you become a Kroger shopper, you're getting those loyal customer mailings, which will allow you to stretch your budget more. And there's also personalized offers that you can go to look at coupons and download those, and there's significant increase in those. So, when you look at -- when you shop with us, obviously, we are a promotional merchant. But when you look at the rewards that we offer between fuel rewards and other rewards and our loyal customer mailings, our basket price overall is within less than cents of our biggest competitor. It's just we go to market and offer a little different way. But it is the reason why loyal shoppers are so important to us because that's the shopper that really gets the full value equation from us.
Gary Millerchip: Rodney, maybe the one thing I would add to John's question, too, the second part would be, I think, John, it's one of the reasons why we do have additional confidence in how we can navigate through the environment is that I think as a combination of our reward program and more customers engaging digitally post COVID, it really does create the ability to channel the dollars in a way that give the customer the most impact and most value while also being able to target it rather than having to sort of peanut butter spread it across in different directions. And I think it's a different dynamic now compared to maybe five, 10 years ago in the way that we're able to personalize that value and go to market.
Rodney McMullen: You've been -- you've followed us for a long time and you would have heard us use the word cherry-pickers and really what it is trying to make sure we do is to give value to customers that are loyal to us as opposed to somebody that's just shopping a discounted item that we're not making any money on.
John Heinbockel: And then maybe as a follow-up, so it sounds like volume is slightly -- is negative, right? I don't know if it's negative 1% or a little more than that, but volume is negative. Is that fair, low single-digit? When do you think that returns to positive territory? And is that solely driven -- if you looked at the budget-conscious customers, because I know a couple of quarters ago, you broke that out. Is that negativity largely driven by that cohort?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look, volume would be slightly negative. If you look, we -- our trends have improved for four quarters in a row from a trend standpoint. That would be largely driven by the value shopper or customers on a budget. And the half full and half empty, the half empty is obviously that's being driven by that customer. Some of that's driven because of the impact from inflation. Part of it's -- or SNAP is down about 30%. The full part is the customers that are loyal, we're continuing to grow with that customer and that customer's profitability is meaningfully better than the value shopper. Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank. Krisztina, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Krisztina Katai: Hi, good morning. So Rodney, I wanted to ask you just a conceptual question on grocery sector and the level of competition, right? Because if we're thinking about it, why wouldn't the sector be more competitive as we head into 2024? The consumer remains under pressure. Some of the low end is under increased pressure. CPGs are raising their support, volumes continue to lag. So that is question one, just conceptually, why wouldn't that be the case? And secondly, how is Kroger positioned in a potentially no inflation to even deflationary backdrop relative to the base case of a normal food-at-home year of low single-digit inflation?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look at, one of the things that makes this industry a lot of fun is we always assume that the business will continue to be more competitive. And if you look at our fundamental business model over the last five years or 10 years or 15 years, every year, we assume that it's going to be more competitive. We worked really hard to identify process changes and cost reductions so that we can continue to fund wage increases and invest in lowering prices for the customer. So, when we look at 2024, and obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail early next year when we give guidance, but right now, we don't see that environment any different than what we would have felt for the last five years or 10 years or 15 years. And the positive is customers get a better value every year and they get a better experience every year. And when you look at for us, one of the things that we think is important for the customers, the customer doesn't have to compromise. So, they get amazing fresh product that will last a long time when they get at home, with amazing friendly associates, with the smile and support that everything in their basket plus a little bit an extra piece of cheese or something they've engaged with Murray, so -- and not have to compromise from a pricing standpoint. So, when you look overall, we feel very good in terms of how we're positioned with the customers that really appreciate what we offer.
Gary Millerchip: Maybe, Rodney, one thing I would just add, too, Krisztina, specific to 2024, a couple of things for Kroger that we think are helpful as we look into next year. One is, of course, that we're cycling the impact of Express Scripts when we get to January and we'll start to see that flow through in the early periods of the year. And then secondly, one of the things that we've seen, as we look at 2023, many states, as you know, reduced the amount of SNAP dollars that were available in the market, and those happened sort of around the middle part of our Q1 last year or this year, I should say. What we've seen in one or two markets where we're cycling those earlier markets where they reduced the SNAP dollars, it certainly starts to create a bit of a different trend in the growth in those markets, too. So, we do think there's, for the industry and specifically for the markets that we operate in, as you start to cycle the impact of those SNAP dollars, which perhaps had a bit more of an impact than we were originally thinking they might across the industry, that starts to create some, I think, tailwind in the industry towards next year's growth as well.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Krisztina.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Ed, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ed Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Ed Kelly: Gary, I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. I think you said that the Q4 gross margin, you expect to be flattish. If you could just confirm that. And then looking out, is the base case for '24 that, that flattish trend would continue? And then, within that context, I'm curious about shrink. And maybe just educate us a little bit on when you do your accounts, the visibility you have on where you stand in shrink, and do you believe it's peaked?
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Ed. So, the first part of the question, yes, you're essentially right that we -- I said in my prepared comments that we would expect Q4 to look very similar to Q3. The way that I sort of would break that down is that we've been equally as pleased with the progress that we've seen in the margin improvement plan initiatives that we saw in the earlier part of the year as well. So, we continue to see strong benefits from Our Brands, strong benefits from sourcing, health and wellness, of course, with Express Scripts is a tailwind this year to gross margin, and supply chain and alternative profits. All those areas continue to generate tailwinds in our gross margin rate. What we did in the third quarter is we did invest more in gross margin to balance those benefits partly in increased pricing and promotion, as Rodney mentioned earlier. And we did also increase advertising costs during the quarter as well. So, those would have been the differences quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we saw and what we would expect to continue to be a similar pattern as we think about the fourth quarter. I'd say as we look into beyond 2023, we certainly still see a lot of potential for the tailwinds that I mentioned around Our Brands sourcing, these areas where we believe that we are on a multiyear path to continue to drive improvement and drive growth. And of course, alternative profit streams continues to grow at a double-digit pace off a bigger base as well. So, I think we still have a lot of confidence in those levers. And what we're doing is making sure we're balancing the business to set ourselves up for continued sustained growth in the future. From a shrink perspective, we would still see shrink as a headwind, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I would say, it's probably somewhat less dramatic for us than maybe some of our peer group because while we have a general merchandise business that's impacted, it's less impacted than probably some of the big-box retailers, but it would still be a headwind to our gross margin rate that would have impacted the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. That headwind actually would have been less than it was in the second quarter, not dramatically, but it would have eased somewhat. So, it's still something that we have to work through and continue to offset, but we are seeing at least the trend in terms of year-over-year growth decelerate, but it would still be a headwind today because of the crime and organized retail crime factors I mentioned earlier.
Rodney McMullen: The other thing I think is important to remember is a lot of our shrink is in our fresh departments. And our fresh departments, actually, a lot of that is, you can manage it by changing processes and using technology. And our teams have done a great job actually on improving shrink in the fresh departments because of our store teams partnering with warehouse teams on processes and leveraging technology as well, and I think as a big chunk of the trend -- slight trend improvements that Gary mentioned.
Ed Kelly: Great point.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky: Rodney, could you talk a little bit about the economy's effect and inflation on your digital business, and I'm thinking particularly about customers' willingness to spend money on any delivery fees or membership fees, and also how the economy might be impacting delivery volumes and digital order volumes?
Rodney McMullen: If you look at overall -- thanks, Chuck. If you look at overall, inflation is definitely stabilizing overall. And it's -- from a customer standpoint, they appreciate the stabilization but they also know the fact that if you look at over the last two years, they've had to endure a lot of inflation. And if you look at some of the fresh departments, some of that has actually returned back to normal. But if you look at on the process side, you wouldn't see that. So, if you look at like eggs, for an example, eggs are significantly deflationary. And we'll all be happy when we get to the point where we're cycling that early next year or next year. If you look at customer behavior, it's fascinating. Customers do a lot of work to save where they want to save or feel like they need to save, so in pack size, if you look at moving to Our Brands versus some of the national brands. But if you look at membership fees and delivery fees and things like that, that business continues to grow strongly. And in fact, it was up double digits and that's what drove the 11%. I'm sure part of that, and any time I talk to a politician, I always remind them, if you look at customers on a budget, they're under a lot of strain and they're doing a lot of behavior changes. If you look at customers that are not as focused on price because inflation hasn't affected them as much, that customers' behavior is still very strong, and they're still continuing to buy big packs, continuing to buy nicer wines, Murray's Cheese, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), things like that. So, we over-index with our membership program on customers that are more mainstream and upscale, so I'm sure that's part of the reason why we're not seeing the behavior change.
Chuck Cerankosky: Okay. Thanks for that. And just real quick, you're exiting the ghost kitchen business. Any particular reason for that?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, great question. Appreciate it. We test a lot of different things, and we'll move on to the next version of it. We still think food away-from-home is a huge growth opportunity for us and we'll continue to focus on it. The ghost kitchen, the few customers that used it, loved it, but it just wasn't enough. So, it's one of those things where you move on. So thanks, Chuck.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to Kroger's digital performance, another quarter of double-digit growth. Did anything surprise you on the digital front? And just any more color in terms of what you guys are seeing delivery versus pickup?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I'll start and let Gary finish. I wouldn't call it a surprise, but it's great to see that the NPS scores, both in terms of our year-on-year from a pickup standpoint and a delivery standpoint is very strong. If you look at our shed delivery business, the repeat rate continues to be strong. So it really is the customers really appreciate that white-glove experience. So, I don't want to make it sound like we're surprised by it, but it's nice to see what we thought play out. Gary, I'll let you...
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, I think you said it well, Rodney. I think the only thing I would add, Rupesh, is that we've said before, we believe that digital is a growth engine for the company. And I think everything we continue to see gives us that belief it will continue to be an opportunity to drive deeper customer engagement and growth. And I mentioned in a comment earlier, but the thing we didn't talk about in the script was we are seeing continued improvement in profitability. So, it's helping profitable growth as well as we're lowering the cost to fill an order, driving more efficiency through technology and continuing to see media revenue growth. So that's the only piece I think that I would reinforce.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kenneth Goldman: Hi, thank you. I'll take a shot here on next year. I know you're not in a position to really give numbers and I wouldn't ask about that now, but you did talk about hopefully having low single-digit sort of normal inflation next year. You highlighted a healthy amount of productivity you expected or expecting. But you also mentioned that maybe your unit growth right now is a little bit disappointing, and you'll surely be lapping some challenging fuel margins that I imagine you won't assume will recur. So, I'm just trying to get a sense if you have maybe sluggish units, fuel comps are tough, to get to your earnings growth algo for next year, do you theoretically have to find other drivers that are better than their algo to offset those headwinds? I just want to kind of get a sense of how to think about at least some initial headwinds and tailwinds into next year, if that all makes sense.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. As you mentioned, we'll definitely share a lot more color, as you might expect, when we get to March. I think as we think about the model and just taking a bigger picture step back, we certainly believe that we've, over the last few years, built a more diverse ecosystem as a company. So, of course, food-at-home is an important part of -- the sort of -- it drives the flywheel. But as you know, we've been continuing to grow our fuel business, continue to grow health and wellness this year even with the impact of Express Groups, and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. So, we look at it more as a journey and we do believe that as we're building the strength in that ecosystem, it creates the -- a new way to generate value for our shareholders over time as we've talked about at previous investor meetings. I mean, I think some of the points you've raised would certainly be the areas where we'll be focusing on. I don't think it's a different strategy for Kroger. It's how do we continue to drive that flywheel as we think about taking cost out of our business so that we can invest more in customers and associates, continuing to drive traffic so we can continue to grow the alternative profit businesses. And we do think there's opportunity for margin improvement to continue beyond 2023, because of the initiatives we're driving around sourcing, supply chain, alternative profit streams, et cetera. So, I think from our perspective, certainly, if you were in a period where you weren't seeing sales growth for a sustained period of time because our model is built on sales growth, we'd have to look at our cost base and we'll look at our cost base in certain areas to be more productive. But we still believe that food-at-home is -- will normalize in the typical pattern that we see of that sort of 1% to 2% inflation over time and sort of 2% to 3% food-at-home growth. And we think our model is really well set up to be able to drive growth within that framework.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ken. The only other thing I would add to Gary's comment is if you look at our seamless business, we would expect that to continue to make progress as well, as I mentioned earlier. Thanks, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As you talk to your processed food and CPG partners, what are they telling you about their desire to further raise prices into next year, given your expectation that there could be typical inflation across the assortments that would necessitate that [indiscernible] prices go up? And this is against the backdrop where volumes continue to go down, you're providing more support. Why are they not rolling back prices to try and drive volume? And as part of that, given that you used your P&L to fund promotions a bit more in the third quarter, is that a sign that you are running into the limitation of the vendors willing to provide support for you to do these promotions? Thank you very much.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael. If you look at overall, they say in economics, all short statements are wrong. And you have CPGs that are all over the board in terms of their approach. Some CPGs are very willing to give up tonnage. And if they are, Our Brands will stay -- will be there for a customer to give them incredible value. And what we find is when a customer tries Our Brands, our repeat rate is incredibly high because of the quality and the value for the money. If you look in the quarter, in terms of funding, it was really done by CPGs and us. And as I mentioned earlier, CPGs were more aggressive in funding some of the promotions in the third quarter than the second quarter, and would expect that to continue. We are seeing more CPGs worrying about their tonnage growth, and I think that's part of what's driving that willingness, too. So, I appreciate the question, and thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Good morning, Rodney and Gary. Thanks for taking our questions.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Kelly Bania: I wanted to go back to the comment about building a more diverse ecosystem and talk a little bit more about alternative profit growth. I think there was a comment that, that is still growing double digits, which I think would mean around $150 million to $200 million in incremental year-over-year profit. But maybe just wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on that if that's the right ballpark. And how many more years can this business continue to grow at double-digit rate into the coming years?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I don't know that Gary and I will want to give the specifics for '24 on the alt profit since we're still going through the process. But we would expect alt profit to be a meaningful contributor of growth next year. And that's really driven by two things. One is our continued growth in our digital business, which is supporting our media business growth. And we think we're just getting started on that. If you look in the media world, your competitors are Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and then a lot of other players. And one of the things that we think transparency is so important in being able to give people good data is we think that is incredibly helpful relative to the Googles and Metas and others. So, we see a long-term opportunity to continue to grow the business there. And the specifics, I don't know that we want to get there either. And if you look at some of the other alternative profit businesses, some of those, we have wide variance of performance within the company. So, part of that growth is just driven by taking best-in-class within our own company and growing that as well. So, Kelly, I appreciate the question. And thanks, everyone, for all the questions. And as always, I'd like to take a few moments to share some comments with our associates listening in. To start, I'd like to say a huge thank you for all the hard work that you've done to make the holidays be so memorable for our customers and what you will do for the -- following the rest of the holiday season to make it equally as memorable for customers. As you know, food plays an important part in any celebration, and it provides an opportunity for people to connect and people that we love, especially with them and sharing special moments. If you had a chance to see our holiday film, you saw that idea come to life. And if you haven't seen our holiday film, you can go to YouTube to look at the full film. And it really does recognize that food connects us all. And whether that's honoring family traditions or creating new family ones, I've just been so inspired to see how our associates and our customers on sharing their videos and the unique ways they celebrate the holidays. As I said before, thank you for everything you do to create special memories for our customers every single day. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Robert Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen, and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline our discussion topics this morning. I will begin by covering the current retail environment and how the strength of Kroger's value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then, Gary will cover our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons, before we open it up for questions. Now, turning to our third quarter. Kroger's third quarter results highlight the strength and diversity of our business model in a challenged operating environment. A strong fuel performance and growth in our alternative profit businesses supported continued adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth. As consumer spending tightens, we are focused on providing customers with exceptional value by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, personalized promotions and rewards. We are growing households and increasing loyalty, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Customers are managing many economic factors that are pressuring their spending, including higher interest rates, reduced savings, and fewer government benefits, including SNAP. Although inflation is decelerating, customers are still adjusting to the impacts from eight consecutive quarters of broad and significant inflation. During the quarter, Kroger grew higher income households once again as our attractive mix of quality, value and convenience continues to drive engagement. By buying larger packs, more fresh items and more premium Our Brands products, these households are more profitable. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are actively looking for value, and our budget-conscious customers are under more significant spending pressure. We are also looking for ways to support customers with additional value, including in-store displays with everyday staples at low price points. We've seen a great response from all customers to these offers. But engagement from our budget-conscious households has been especially strong. Customers purchasing these offer items are making more trips and buying more units, not only recognizing the value with these displays, but the value across the entire store. To help more customers manage their budget, we are only deepening our commitment to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Our personalized promotions are an increasingly critical way for customers to save on items that matter most to them. We are applying analytics to Kroger's unmatched purchase data to strike the right balance between the depth and breadth of promotions. To ensure customers were able to enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, for example, we created a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person, which represents a lower price than last year. We have a long history of delivering value to our customers by providing a broad assortment of fresh foods at low prices through our unique omnichannel shopping experience. We achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of total household growth and increased loyal households even faster, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Now, I'll provide more details about how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. Starting with seamless. [Technical Difficulty] Our digital business delivered a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses. Multiple tailwinds are driving our sales momentum, including growth in both households and visits. Our new two-hour pickup service available in more than one-third of our stores also contributed to our success in the quarter. To become the online food retailer of choice, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment. Our teams improved key customer experience metrics in pickup, increasing fill rates and reducing wait times during the quarter. This resulted in an improved net promoter scores. Our customer fulfillment centers again led our delivery growth, where we continue to rapidly increase households. Our delivery customers enjoy the convenience of on-time refrigerated delivery directly to their doorstep with zero compromise on freshness, quality, and value. Turning to personalization. Investments in our personalized capabilities ensure we are meeting elevated customer demand for savings and enables us to deploy promotional dollars more effectively. Digital offers have increased compared to last year and our personalization capabilities have resulted in even more significant increase in redemptions, driving loyalty and increasing digitally-engaged households this quarter by 13%. Digitally-engaged households are incredibly valuable to our model as they are more loyal, spend nearly 3 times more with us, and accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. Now, I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model supported earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Growth in alternative profit businesses remained strong in the third quarter with balanced growth across the portfolio. The strength of our seamless ecosystem and elevated digital engagement is having a flywheel effect, creating the traffic and the data needed to drive growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, a higher-margin profit stream. Recently, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of KPM. This quarter, KPM made an important step in its journey to become the most trusted and transparent media company. By activating ad buying platforms, we are offering more self-service solutions to meet clients where they are today, providing advertisers more direct access to custom Kroger audiences. This first iteration has already launched, and KPM expects to expand to other buying platforms in the future. These new innovative features will help accelerate KPM's impressive growth by allowing advertisers to reduce waste and enhance measurement tools. Kroger Health had a strong quarter that exceeded our internal expectations and helped drive sales and profit growth. Our decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our customers and shareholders. Our teams have done an excellent job retaining patients and utilizing our pharmacists' extra capacity to devote more time to patient care, including growing our number of vaccinations. Gary will provide more on the financial impact of this later. During the quarter, we continued to see rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs in our retail pharmacies. While the long-term impacts of these drugs on customer buying habits are unknown, Kroger's 'Food as Medicine' philosophy positions us well to support our customers' health and wellness goals. Our comprehensive approach includes healthcare services, professional dietitians, and proprietary tools like our nutrition rating app, OptUP, which are all designed to support healthy living and to do so holistically. While we pride ourselves on data and insights, the patient data in our pharmacy operations is separate from our customer loyalty data and is protected by privacy laws. We are committed to using our data in an appropriate manner while not jeopardizing customers' trust. For now, we have not seen any major macro shifts in customer eating habits or spending behaviors. Food trends are constantly evolving, and we are committed to offering products that meet our customers' needs. For customers looking to adopt healthier habits with or without the help of these drugs, we are well-positioned to provide important healthcare services and healthy food options. At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, and I'm so impressed by the many ways our associates bring this to life every day in the ways they support our customers and each other. We know when associates are connected to our purpose, they feel connected to Kroger. Our annual Kroger Wellness Festival is just one example of living our purpose. This festival is one of the nation's largest health and wellness events, showcasing more than a 150 experiences and food offerings. Sponsors and celebrities joined Kroger in hundreds of thousands of visitors to share our vision for better physical, mental, and emotional health for families. It was wonderful to see the level of support and participation in this important mission. Also this quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which highlighted Kroger's significant progress on our 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' journey to expand access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food, and to reduce waste, especially food waste, across our footprint. Since we launched 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' in 2017, Kroger has donated more than 3 billion meals to feed hungry families, including more than 1.3 billion to fight food insecurity and nearly 600 million pounds of surplus food to our food bank partners. I am so proud of our teams and their efforts to reach these incredible milestones. Our associates are the driving force behind our success by delivering an outstanding customer experience and helping make the holidays even more special for our customers. We facilitate this through our long-standing commitment to invest in associate wages and benefits and training tools to advance their career growth. Feed Your Future, our continuing education benefit, is one of the important ways we make Kroger a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. This benefit provides up to $21,000 lifeline, and it's helped almost 6,000 associates this year alone, with approximately 90% of these participants being hourly. Our focus on development is contributing to strong improvements in retention, which includes associate continuity and a more consistent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are allowing Kroger to navigate a challenged environment, characterized by tightening consumer spending and food-at-home disinflation. We achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% this quarter, while also providing greater value for our customers, higher wages for our associates, and investing in strategic initiatives that will support future growth. This was made possible by our teams delivering strong performances across our margin expansion initiatives, fuel, alternative profit businesses, and health and wellness. Our year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023, building on record results over the prior three years. I'll now provide more detail on our third quarter. Identical sales without fuel decreased 0.6%. Underlying growth would have been positive 1% adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first two quarters of the year, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel and a negative effect on the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall net effect on operating profit was slightly positive. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle the impact of Express Scripts at the start of the new calendar year. Turning back to identical sales without fuel. As Rodney shared earlier, our seamless ecosystem is a critical component of our growth strategy, building customer loyalty and fueling our alternative profit businesses. Digital sales were a highlight in the quarter, growing 11%. Our overall sales continue to be affected by industry-wide disinflation. Inflation ended quarter three in the low-single digits, approximately 270 basis points lower than the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw inflation decline at a slower pace, and we would expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining positive at the year-end. Encouragingly, units have shown signs of improvement as inflation has decelerated, and we have sequentially improved units for four straight quarters. However, unit growth rates have lagged the rate of inflation decline and have not improved at the pace we would have expected. As a team, we are laser-focused on returning to unit growth and expect improvement in volumes to continue for the balance of the year. Gross margin was 22% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel increased 3 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we increased investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, and we were able to successfully fund these investments by continuing to execute our long-term margin improvement plan, including Our Brands optimization, sourcing efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Shrink was a headwind to gross margin during the quarter, primarily due to the continued rise in industry-wide theft and organized retail crime. We are investing in initiatives to mitigate shrink and protect our associates and customers in our stores. Looking ahead, we would expect these same factors that influence gross margin in quarter three will drive a similar outcome for gross margin rate in the fourth quarter. During quarter three, we recorded a LIFO charge of $29 million compared to a charge of $152 million for the same quarter last year. This reduction was due to inflation returning to low-single digits compared to double-digit growth experienced last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 32 basis points excluding fuel and adjustment items. The increase in OG&A rate was driven by planned investments in associate wages and benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. During the quarter, we also made the decision to invest in a number of strategic initiatives that are expected to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Investments were partially offset by execution of cost saving initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. We are confident in our ability to effectively manage costs and continue to deliver savings by eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience. We continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities across the business and remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. In the fourth quarter, we would expect our OG&A rate to be relatively flat compared to last year. Kroger Health is an important component of our value creation model and is delivering profitable growth in 2023. During the quarter, the team exceeded our internal goal for the number of vaccinations administered, and the higher profit margins associated with these vaccines helped offset the negative impact on margin rate from growth in GLP-1 drugs. As Rodney shared earlier, we are excited about the momentum in health and wellness, and see significant potential for future profitable growth in this area of our business. Fuel is also a key part of our strategy and through our rewards program is another way that we deliver value for customers and increase loyalty. Our fuel team did an outstanding job delivering results that were ahead of expectations in the third quarter. Our customers saved 14% more in rewards per fuel purchase compared to last year, which led to gallon sales outpacing the industry. The average retail price of fuel was $3.77 this quarter versus $3.84 last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.57 this quarter versus $0.50 last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. Kroger has made substantial investments over the last five years in our associates, raising the average hourly wage by more than 33%. We remain committed to supporting our associates with sustainable investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that will, at the same time, allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities that we serve. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drug, Dallas Meat and four stores in Roundy's, in total covering more than 19,000 associates. We have now ratified all agreements that were scheduled for negotiation in 2023. Turning to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and the disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4, which remains well below our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.3 to 2.5. This positions us well to execute our financing strategy to close the proposed merger with Albertsons early in 2024 and then quickly return to within our target leverage range post-merger. As I wrap up my comments on the quarter, let me provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Today, we updated our full-year guidance to reflect the impact of near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation. We now expect full-year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1%, and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023. Our latest sales trends would put us on track to achieve the midpoint of our updated annual sales guidance range. Importantly, we would expect to exit quarter four with a stronger sales trend than our overall results for the quarter as we start to cycle the effect of Express Scripts in January. We believe we are well-positioned to navigate near-term headwinds and the strength we are seeing in our alternative profit businesses, health and wellness and fuel, combined with a lower expected LIFO charge, gives us the confidence to raise the lower-end of our full-year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance range. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 to $4.60. And looking forward, Kroger remains committed to delivering attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with  Albertsons Companies . As of November 15, 2023, Kroger certified substantial compliance with the second request issued by the FTC. We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction. This step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement, including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S is a well-qualified buyer who meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction and will ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger. Frontline (NYSE:FRO) associates will remain employed and existing collective bargaining agreements will continue. We have made a compelling case to both Kroger and Albertsons stakeholders. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for our customers by lowering prices beginning on day one, extends our commitment to associates by increasing wages and benefits, and deepens trust with our communities by keeping stores open to assure America has access to fresh and affordable food. In terms of integration planning, we are progressing well. Our integration teams have made significant progress toward our first goal, which is to ensure continuity for associates and customers at closing. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both organizations and how we'll be able to learn from each other to provide customers with an even stronger food retail experience and compete even more effectively against larger non-union operators in the future. In closing, Kroger delivered another quarter of solid results. We are demonstrating our ability to manage through a more challenged environment and remain committed to balancing our investments in our associates and in lower prices for our customers, while continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Dean Rosenblum of Bernstein. Dean, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dean Rosenblum: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Hey, my question is really about a debate regarding the gross profit and operating profit impact of increasing digital sales. I mean, online was -- digital sales were up 11% this quarter on a total comp, ex Express Scripts of 1%, which says it's growing share. Can you help us understand -- I know you think about it in terms of the whole digital ecosystem, including the alternative revenues. But in terms of the actual operating profit contribution from digital relative to the stores, can you help us understand how to think about that as that mix continues to increase?
Rodney McMullen: If you look currently, digital would not be as profitable as stores. We do believe over time, that will change, and we think that'll change by multiple things, the overall ecosystem. If you look at the pickup, we continue to make significant progress on reducing the cost to serve a customer on pickup. If you look at our sheds, we continue to make progress on our sheds to get them to where the profitability of the shed would be the same as the store. So, if you just step back, kind of, we view job one is make sure we don't lose the customer. And what we find is that customer over time will spend more with us when they're engaged with us through pickup, delivery, and in-store. And then, obviously, if you look at the incremental profitability that is making meaningful progress, and we also, when you include media as well, that's making progress. So, if you look initially, it is not as profitable, but we have every expectations over time that it will be.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, Rodney, maybe just to add, Dean, a couple of specific data points. Can you hear me okay?
Dean Rosenblum: Yeah, please.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Dean, I think we talked, Dean, before about, we sort of bucket our digital business into two areas, the sort of the business prior to launching our CFCs, which will be pickup and delivery through our third-party providers, and then our customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado (LON:OCDO). We've talked before about the pickup and delivery business sort of having a pass-through profitability rate on incremental sales of around 5% or mid-single-digit percent and the store being sort of north of 15%. And we talked a couple of years ago about being on a journey to improving that pass-through rate through some of the things that Rodney mentioned around improving mix, around improving media revenue per transaction, and then also lowering the cost to fill a digital order. We've made good progress on all three of those areas, and we would certainly see now sort of the digital pass-through profitability heading towards that double-digit rate sort of on that journey towards getting towards parity in terms of overall profitability. And then, the Ocado CFCs, we're really still very much in the early stages of that journey where the total investment is sort of starting to peak and we're starting to see tailwinds in that profitability as we start to achieve more scale in those facilities.
Dean Rosenblum: That's great. Thanks so much, Gary. My follow-up question is, you mentioned certifying the second request substantial completion on November 15th. That would suggest that the FTC now has 30 days to either make a decision or to extend the period. Do you have any sense right now as to whether we might expect some sort of an FTC decision or that the FTC is more likely to extend the time for that decision?
Rodney McMullen: Dean, it's a great question. And if you look as you -- in our prepared comments, we expect to close in early 2024 as we have all along. We continue to have a cooperative relationship with the FTC and other interested parties, and it's still too early in terms of specific dates. Thanks, Dean.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Kessler: Hi there. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks, guys. Maybe starting with the question on your inflation or deflation outlook for 2024, what your current expectation is? And what would need to happen in the backdrop for us to see either deflation or a return to more modest inflation? And in the event that we see deflation, is there a scenario in which you can hold or still expand margins, even in that kind of backdrop?
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, thanks for the question. As you know, we'll certainly provide a lot more specific details of our outlook for 2024 when we get to our quarter four earnings in March. And we're continuing, as I'm sure many are in the market, to look at all the data points we see both internally and externally. We're probably looking at some of the same data sources that you are from the top likes of USDA and other published sources. I think our view right now, we recognize we don't have the perfect crystal ball and we'll continue to watch and evaluate how we see the outlook for next year. But overall, most of the data that we're seeing would tend to point towards more of a typical year next year for food-at-home with food-at-home inflation being in the low single-digit range. We certainly think there are different scenarios that can play out. And of course, we'll look to adapt our model as we would need to, if those were the case, but that would be the data that we're watching. And we'll certainly provide more color when we get to the March earnings and talk specifically about our 2024 views.
Rodney McMullen: And one of the things that Gary always reminds me of, if you look over the last 50 years, there's only been two years out of the last 50 where it's been negative, where there's been actual deflation in a year. And as you know, we've been able to maintain and create strong business results in all environments, whether it's inflationary or deflationary, and you just manage accordingly.
Michael Kessler: Okay, great. And then, a quick follow-up on the fuel business, which had higher-than-expected profitability. So, can you talk about what drove that? And is there any interplay, I guess, between that business and the core supermarket business, if there's any balancing of the profitability dynamics and what you're able to earn to kind of manage the P&L? Or this is being managed separately and it just happened to come in a little stronger in Q3? Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, Gary mentioned it, but we're super proud of our fuel team and the partnership with all the divisions. We had a significant increase in the amount of fuel rewards that were issued, so we really look at leveraging both of the businesses to support each other. The other thing that the fuel team has done a nice job on is making sure from an efficiency standpoint on deliveries, on procurement and all the ingredients as well. So really proud of what they've done, but it really is we leverage both sides of the business to support each other and feel really good about where that business turned out. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Montani: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on two fronts. One was just if you could discuss the overall competitive backdrop? And then, secondly, we've heard a fair amount of promotions could uptick into next year. And I guess the question on that would be, what do you see in terms of vendor support versus you all having to fund that yourselves? And then, the follow-up was just OG&A dollar growth. Is there still potential for $1 billion cost-out into '24? And what kind of dollar growth should we look for underlying in the fourth quarter?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I'll answer the competitive backdrop and promotions, and if Gary wants to add anything, he can. And then, I'll let Gary ask about -- or answer the OG&A. If you look at overall, from a competitive standpoint, the market feels very similar than what it has been for a long time. If you look at the promotional activity, CPGs are increasing their funding on promotional. And I think there's two things driving that. One is CPG is not being satisfied with their tonnage so they're increasing the amount of support. The other thing for everyone is the supply chain constraints that would have been in place a year ago and two years ago is real getting back to normal. So, people are beginning to feel comfortable on promoting again, where the worst thing that could have happened is for us or for a CPG to promote something and then not have adequate supply. So, it really is behaviors getting back to pre-COVID. And even if you look at shopping during Thanksgiving, it was really more last minute, which really reflected, if you go back and look at pre COVID, it's kind of what it was, and people getting comfortable there will be products there when they go to buy it. So both great questions, but that's really what we're seeing right now. And Gary, on the OG&A.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Rodney. So, in OG&A, I'll just maybe take a step back as well and just mention a couple of points that I talked about in the third quarter. As we looked at the third quarter going into it, we would have expected OG&A to be a little bit lower as a rate. The things that were in the plan would have been the investments in average hourly rates and increasing wages for our associates in our stores and supply chain network and also the impact of ESI, and they were very much in line with what we expected. The real differences in the third quarter were that we did make some decisions during the quarter to make some strategic investments that we believe will help set up 2024 and beyond in terms of continued revenue growth, but also additional cost savings. So, as we look at the fourth quarter, we actually believe that the trends in average hourly rate will continue, and of course, Express Scripts will continue to be a factor. But outside of that, we'd expect OG&A to be relatively flat during the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still see both a sort of tailwind from initiatives that we've launched this year that will have a run rate benefit into next year. And we still see good line of sight to continued cost savings by leveraging technology and improving efficiency, driving continued improvement in cost to serve in digital and a number of areas of the business. So, we would remain confident that we see a good line of sight to continue to find that sort of 3% to 5% productivity improvements that we target to make sure we can continue to invest in our customers and continue to invest in our associates.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John, please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with, can you talk to -- if you think about the promotional basket, proactive versus reactive on your end, right, kind of is it -- would you say, I don't know, 80% proactive, 20% reactive? I don't know how you think about that. And then, on the reactive side, it would seem that those without a loyalty program would be at a disadvantage to you and that you can see what's going on in the market and possibly respond where yours is more stealth. Is that even remotely how you run the business, right, where you can respond to others based on what you see out there?
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, John, for the question. By far, the majority, and when I say majority would be almost all would be proactive versus reactive. Now, all our teams will check prices every single week and there'll be adjustments based on that. But by far, the majority of our discounts are proactive. And some of that is what you can see in an ad. A lot of that is the things that you've mentioned in terms of direct to individual household offers. It's one of the things that we believe the reason why our loyal households continue to grow and some of those aspects is once you become a Kroger shopper, you're getting those loyal customer mailings, which will allow you to stretch your budget more. And there's also personalized offers that you can go to look at coupons and download those, and there's significant increase in those. So, when you look at -- when you shop with us, obviously, we are a promotional merchant. But when you look at the rewards that we offer between fuel rewards and other rewards and our loyal customer mailings, our basket price overall is within less than cents of our biggest competitor. It's just we go to market and offer a little different way. But it is the reason why loyal shoppers are so important to us because that's the shopper that really gets the full value equation from us.
Gary Millerchip: Rodney, maybe the one thing I would add to John's question, too, the second part would be, I think, John, it's one of the reasons why we do have additional confidence in how we can navigate through the environment is that I think as a combination of our reward program and more customers engaging digitally post COVID, it really does create the ability to channel the dollars in a way that give the customer the most impact and most value while also being able to target it rather than having to sort of peanut butter spread it across in different directions. And I think it's a different dynamic now compared to maybe five, 10 years ago in the way that we're able to personalize that value and go to market.
Rodney McMullen: You've been -- you've followed us for a long time and you would have heard us use the word cherry-pickers and really what it is trying to make sure we do is to give value to customers that are loyal to us as opposed to somebody that's just shopping a discounted item that we're not making any money on.
John Heinbockel: And then maybe as a follow-up, so it sounds like volume is slightly -- is negative, right? I don't know if it's negative 1% or a little more than that, but volume is negative. Is that fair, low single-digit? When do you think that returns to positive territory? And is that solely driven -- if you looked at the budget-conscious customers, because I know a couple of quarters ago, you broke that out. Is that negativity largely driven by that cohort?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look, volume would be slightly negative. If you look, we -- our trends have improved for four quarters in a row from a trend standpoint. That would be largely driven by the value shopper or customers on a budget. And the half full and half empty, the half empty is obviously that's being driven by that customer. Some of that's driven because of the impact from inflation. Part of it's -- or SNAP is down about 30%. The full part is the customers that are loyal, we're continuing to grow with that customer and that customer's profitability is meaningfully better than the value shopper. Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank. Krisztina, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Krisztina Katai: Hi, good morning. So Rodney, I wanted to ask you just a conceptual question on grocery sector and the level of competition, right? Because if we're thinking about it, why wouldn't the sector be more competitive as we head into 2024? The consumer remains under pressure. Some of the low end is under increased pressure. CPGs are raising their support, volumes continue to lag. So that is question one, just conceptually, why wouldn't that be the case? And secondly, how is Kroger positioned in a potentially no inflation to even deflationary backdrop relative to the base case of a normal food-at-home year of low single-digit inflation?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look at, one of the things that makes this industry a lot of fun is we always assume that the business will continue to be more competitive. And if you look at our fundamental business model over the last five years or 10 years or 15 years, every year, we assume that it's going to be more competitive. We worked really hard to identify process changes and cost reductions so that we can continue to fund wage increases and invest in lowering prices for the customer. So, when we look at 2024, and obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail early next year when we give guidance, but right now, we don't see that environment any different than what we would have felt for the last five years or 10 years or 15 years. And the positive is customers get a better value every year and they get a better experience every year. And when you look at for us, one of the things that we think is important for the customers, the customer doesn't have to compromise. So, they get amazing fresh product that will last a long time when they get at home, with amazing friendly associates, with the smile and support that everything in their basket plus a little bit an extra piece of cheese or something they've engaged with Murray, so -- and not have to compromise from a pricing standpoint. So, when you look overall, we feel very good in terms of how we're positioned with the customers that really appreciate what we offer.
Gary Millerchip: Maybe, Rodney, one thing I would just add, too, Krisztina, specific to 2024, a couple of things for Kroger that we think are helpful as we look into next year. One is, of course, that we're cycling the impact of Express Scripts when we get to January and we'll start to see that flow through in the early periods of the year. And then secondly, one of the things that we've seen, as we look at 2023, many states, as you know, reduced the amount of SNAP dollars that were available in the market, and those happened sort of around the middle part of our Q1 last year or this year, I should say. What we've seen in one or two markets where we're cycling those earlier markets where they reduced the SNAP dollars, it certainly starts to create a bit of a different trend in the growth in those markets, too. So, we do think there's, for the industry and specifically for the markets that we operate in, as you start to cycle the impact of those SNAP dollars, which perhaps had a bit more of an impact than we were originally thinking they might across the industry, that starts to create some, I think, tailwind in the industry towards next year's growth as well.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Krisztina.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Ed, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ed Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Ed Kelly: Gary, I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. I think you said that the Q4 gross margin, you expect to be flattish. If you could just confirm that. And then looking out, is the base case for '24 that, that flattish trend would continue? And then, within that context, I'm curious about shrink. And maybe just educate us a little bit on when you do your accounts, the visibility you have on where you stand in shrink, and do you believe it's peaked?
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Ed. So, the first part of the question, yes, you're essentially right that we -- I said in my prepared comments that we would expect Q4 to look very similar to Q3. The way that I sort of would break that down is that we've been equally as pleased with the progress that we've seen in the margin improvement plan initiatives that we saw in the earlier part of the year as well. So, we continue to see strong benefits from Our Brands, strong benefits from sourcing, health and wellness, of course, with Express Scripts is a tailwind this year to gross margin, and supply chain and alternative profits. All those areas continue to generate tailwinds in our gross margin rate. What we did in the third quarter is we did invest more in gross margin to balance those benefits partly in increased pricing and promotion, as Rodney mentioned earlier. And we did also increase advertising costs during the quarter as well. So, those would have been the differences quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we saw and what we would expect to continue to be a similar pattern as we think about the fourth quarter. I'd say as we look into beyond 2023, we certainly still see a lot of potential for the tailwinds that I mentioned around Our Brands sourcing, these areas where we believe that we are on a multiyear path to continue to drive improvement and drive growth. And of course, alternative profit streams continues to grow at a double-digit pace off a bigger base as well. So, I think we still have a lot of confidence in those levers. And what we're doing is making sure we're balancing the business to set ourselves up for continued sustained growth in the future. From a shrink perspective, we would still see shrink as a headwind, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I would say, it's probably somewhat less dramatic for us than maybe some of our peer group because while we have a general merchandise business that's impacted, it's less impacted than probably some of the big-box retailers, but it would still be a headwind to our gross margin rate that would have impacted the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. That headwind actually would have been less than it was in the second quarter, not dramatically, but it would have eased somewhat. So, it's still something that we have to work through and continue to offset, but we are seeing at least the trend in terms of year-over-year growth decelerate, but it would still be a headwind today because of the crime and organized retail crime factors I mentioned earlier.
Rodney McMullen: The other thing I think is important to remember is a lot of our shrink is in our fresh departments. And our fresh departments, actually, a lot of that is, you can manage it by changing processes and using technology. And our teams have done a great job actually on improving shrink in the fresh departments because of our store teams partnering with warehouse teams on processes and leveraging technology as well, and I think as a big chunk of the trend -- slight trend improvements that Gary mentioned.
Ed Kelly: Great point.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky: Rodney, could you talk a little bit about the economy's effect and inflation on your digital business, and I'm thinking particularly about customers' willingness to spend money on any delivery fees or membership fees, and also how the economy might be impacting delivery volumes and digital order volumes?
Rodney McMullen: If you look at overall -- thanks, Chuck. If you look at overall, inflation is definitely stabilizing overall. And it's -- from a customer standpoint, they appreciate the stabilization but they also know the fact that if you look at over the last two years, they've had to endure a lot of inflation. And if you look at some of the fresh departments, some of that has actually returned back to normal. But if you look at on the process side, you wouldn't see that. So, if you look at like eggs, for an example, eggs are significantly deflationary. And we'll all be happy when we get to the point where we're cycling that early next year or next year. If you look at customer behavior, it's fascinating. Customers do a lot of work to save where they want to save or feel like they need to save, so in pack size, if you look at moving to Our Brands versus some of the national brands. But if you look at membership fees and delivery fees and things like that, that business continues to grow strongly. And in fact, it was up double digits and that's what drove the 11%. I'm sure part of that, and any time I talk to a politician, I always remind them, if you look at customers on a budget, they're under a lot of strain and they're doing a lot of behavior changes. If you look at customers that are not as focused on price because inflation hasn't affected them as much, that customers' behavior is still very strong, and they're still continuing to buy big packs, continuing to buy nicer wines, Murray's Cheese, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), things like that. So, we over-index with our membership program on customers that are more mainstream and upscale, so I'm sure that's part of the reason why we're not seeing the behavior change.
Chuck Cerankosky: Okay. Thanks for that. And just real quick, you're exiting the ghost kitchen business. Any particular reason for that?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, great question. Appreciate it. We test a lot of different things, and we'll move on to the next version of it. We still think food away-from-home is a huge growth opportunity for us and we'll continue to focus on it. The ghost kitchen, the few customers that used it, loved it, but it just wasn't enough. So, it's one of those things where you move on. So thanks, Chuck.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to Kroger's digital performance, another quarter of double-digit growth. Did anything surprise you on the digital front? And just any more color in terms of what you guys are seeing delivery versus pickup?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I'll start and let Gary finish. I wouldn't call it a surprise, but it's great to see that the NPS scores, both in terms of our year-on-year from a pickup standpoint and a delivery standpoint is very strong. If you look at our shed delivery business, the repeat rate continues to be strong. So it really is the customers really appreciate that white-glove experience. So, I don't want to make it sound like we're surprised by it, but it's nice to see what we thought play out. Gary, I'll let you...
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, I think you said it well, Rodney. I think the only thing I would add, Rupesh, is that we've said before, we believe that digital is a growth engine for the company. And I think everything we continue to see gives us that belief it will continue to be an opportunity to drive deeper customer engagement and growth. And I mentioned in a comment earlier, but the thing we didn't talk about in the script was we are seeing continued improvement in profitability. So, it's helping profitable growth as well as we're lowering the cost to fill an order, driving more efficiency through technology and continuing to see media revenue growth. So that's the only piece I think that I would reinforce.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kenneth Goldman: Hi, thank you. I'll take a shot here on next year. I know you're not in a position to really give numbers and I wouldn't ask about that now, but you did talk about hopefully having low single-digit sort of normal inflation next year. You highlighted a healthy amount of productivity you expected or expecting. But you also mentioned that maybe your unit growth right now is a little bit disappointing, and you'll surely be lapping some challenging fuel margins that I imagine you won't assume will recur. So, I'm just trying to get a sense if you have maybe sluggish units, fuel comps are tough, to get to your earnings growth algo for next year, do you theoretically have to find other drivers that are better than their algo to offset those headwinds? I just want to kind of get a sense of how to think about at least some initial headwinds and tailwinds into next year, if that all makes sense.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. As you mentioned, we'll definitely share a lot more color, as you might expect, when we get to March. I think as we think about the model and just taking a bigger picture step back, we certainly believe that we've, over the last few years, built a more diverse ecosystem as a company. So, of course, food-at-home is an important part of -- the sort of -- it drives the flywheel. But as you know, we've been continuing to grow our fuel business, continue to grow health and wellness this year even with the impact of Express Groups, and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. So, we look at it more as a journey and we do believe that as we're building the strength in that ecosystem, it creates the -- a new way to generate value for our shareholders over time as we've talked about at previous investor meetings. I mean, I think some of the points you've raised would certainly be the areas where we'll be focusing on. I don't think it's a different strategy for Kroger. It's how do we continue to drive that flywheel as we think about taking cost out of our business so that we can invest more in customers and associates, continuing to drive traffic so we can continue to grow the alternative profit businesses. And we do think there's opportunity for margin improvement to continue beyond 2023, because of the initiatives we're driving around sourcing, supply chain, alternative profit streams, et cetera. So, I think from our perspective, certainly, if you were in a period where you weren't seeing sales growth for a sustained period of time because our model is built on sales growth, we'd have to look at our cost base and we'll look at our cost base in certain areas to be more productive. But we still believe that food-at-home is -- will normalize in the typical pattern that we see of that sort of 1% to 2% inflation over time and sort of 2% to 3% food-at-home growth. And we think our model is really well set up to be able to drive growth within that framework.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ken. The only other thing I would add to Gary's comment is if you look at our seamless business, we would expect that to continue to make progress as well, as I mentioned earlier. Thanks, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As you talk to your processed food and CPG partners, what are they telling you about their desire to further raise prices into next year, given your expectation that there could be typical inflation across the assortments that would necessitate that [indiscernible] prices go up? And this is against the backdrop where volumes continue to go down, you're providing more support. Why are they not rolling back prices to try and drive volume? And as part of that, given that you used your P&L to fund promotions a bit more in the third quarter, is that a sign that you are running into the limitation of the vendors willing to provide support for you to do these promotions? Thank you very much.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael. If you look at overall, they say in economics, all short statements are wrong. And you have CPGs that are all over the board in terms of their approach. Some CPGs are very willing to give up tonnage. And if they are, Our Brands will stay -- will be there for a customer to give them incredible value. And what we find is when a customer tries Our Brands, our repeat rate is incredibly high because of the quality and the value for the money. If you look in the quarter, in terms of funding, it was really done by CPGs and us. And as I mentioned earlier, CPGs were more aggressive in funding some of the promotions in the third quarter than the second quarter, and would expect that to continue. We are seeing more CPGs worrying about their tonnage growth, and I think that's part of what's driving that willingness, too. So, I appreciate the question, and thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Good morning, Rodney and Gary. Thanks for taking our questions.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Kelly Bania: I wanted to go back to the comment about building a more diverse ecosystem and talk a little bit more about alternative profit growth. I think there was a comment that, that is still growing double digits, which I think would mean around $150 million to $200 million in incremental year-over-year profit. But maybe just wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on that if that's the right ballpark. And how many more years can this business continue to grow at double-digit rate into the coming years?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I don't know that Gary and I will want to give the specifics for '24 on the alt profit since we're still going through the process. But we would expect alt profit to be a meaningful contributor of growth next year. And that's really driven by two things. One is our continued growth in our digital business, which is supporting our media business growth. And we think we're just getting started on that. If you look in the media world, your competitors are Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and then a lot of other players. And one of the things that we think transparency is so important in being able to give people good data is we think that is incredibly helpful relative to the Googles and Metas and others. So, we see a long-term opportunity to continue to grow the business there. And the specifics, I don't know that we want to get there either. And if you look at some of the other alternative profit businesses, some of those, we have wide variance of performance within the company. So, part of that growth is just driven by taking best-in-class within our own company and growing that as well. So, Kelly, I appreciate the question. And thanks, everyone, for all the questions. And as always, I'd like to take a few moments to share some comments with our associates listening in. To start, I'd like to say a huge thank you for all the hard work that you've done to make the holidays be so memorable for our customers and what you will do for the -- following the rest of the holiday season to make it equally as memorable for customers. As you know, food plays an important part in any celebration, and it provides an opportunity for people to connect and people that we love, especially with them and sharing special moments. If you had a chance to see our holiday film, you saw that idea come to life. And if you haven't seen our holiday film, you can go to YouTube to look at the full film. And it really does recognize that food connects us all. And whether that's honoring family traditions or creating new family ones, I've just been so inspired to see how our associates and our customers on sharing their videos and the unique ways they celebrate the holidays. As I said before, thank you for everything you do to create special memories for our customers every single day. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Robert Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen, and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline our discussion topics this morning. I will begin by covering the current retail environment and how the strength of Kroger's value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then, Gary will cover our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons, before we open it up for questions. Now, turning to our third quarter. Kroger's third quarter results highlight the strength and diversity of our business model in a challenged operating environment. A strong fuel performance and growth in our alternative profit businesses supported continued adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth. As consumer spending tightens, we are focused on providing customers with exceptional value by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, personalized promotions and rewards. We are growing households and increasing loyalty, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Customers are managing many economic factors that are pressuring their spending, including higher interest rates, reduced savings, and fewer government benefits, including SNAP. Although inflation is decelerating, customers are still adjusting to the impacts from eight consecutive quarters of broad and significant inflation. During the quarter, Kroger grew higher income households once again as our attractive mix of quality, value and convenience continues to drive engagement. By buying larger packs, more fresh items and more premium Our Brands products, these households are more profitable. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are actively looking for value, and our budget-conscious customers are under more significant spending pressure. We are also looking for ways to support customers with additional value, including in-store displays with everyday staples at low price points. We've seen a great response from all customers to these offers. But engagement from our budget-conscious households has been especially strong. Customers purchasing these offer items are making more trips and buying more units, not only recognizing the value with these displays, but the value across the entire store. To help more customers manage their budget, we are only deepening our commitment to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Our personalized promotions are an increasingly critical way for customers to save on items that matter most to them. We are applying analytics to Kroger's unmatched purchase data to strike the right balance between the depth and breadth of promotions. To ensure customers were able to enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, for example, we created a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person, which represents a lower price than last year. We have a long history of delivering value to our customers by providing a broad assortment of fresh foods at low prices through our unique omnichannel shopping experience. We achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of total household growth and increased loyal households even faster, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Now, I'll provide more details about how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. Starting with seamless. [Technical Difficulty] Our digital business delivered a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses. Multiple tailwinds are driving our sales momentum, including growth in both households and visits. Our new two-hour pickup service available in more than one-third of our stores also contributed to our success in the quarter. To become the online food retailer of choice, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment. Our teams improved key customer experience metrics in pickup, increasing fill rates and reducing wait times during the quarter. This resulted in an improved net promoter scores. Our customer fulfillment centers again led our delivery growth, where we continue to rapidly increase households. Our delivery customers enjoy the convenience of on-time refrigerated delivery directly to their doorstep with zero compromise on freshness, quality, and value. Turning to personalization. Investments in our personalized capabilities ensure we are meeting elevated customer demand for savings and enables us to deploy promotional dollars more effectively. Digital offers have increased compared to last year and our personalization capabilities have resulted in even more significant increase in redemptions, driving loyalty and increasing digitally-engaged households this quarter by 13%. Digitally-engaged households are incredibly valuable to our model as they are more loyal, spend nearly 3 times more with us, and accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. Now, I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model supported earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Growth in alternative profit businesses remained strong in the third quarter with balanced growth across the portfolio. The strength of our seamless ecosystem and elevated digital engagement is having a flywheel effect, creating the traffic and the data needed to drive growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, a higher-margin profit stream. Recently, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of KPM. This quarter, KPM made an important step in its journey to become the most trusted and transparent media company. By activating ad buying platforms, we are offering more self-service solutions to meet clients where they are today, providing advertisers more direct access to custom Kroger audiences. This first iteration has already launched, and KPM expects to expand to other buying platforms in the future. These new innovative features will help accelerate KPM's impressive growth by allowing advertisers to reduce waste and enhance measurement tools. Kroger Health had a strong quarter that exceeded our internal expectations and helped drive sales and profit growth. Our decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our customers and shareholders. Our teams have done an excellent job retaining patients and utilizing our pharmacists' extra capacity to devote more time to patient care, including growing our number of vaccinations. Gary will provide more on the financial impact of this later. During the quarter, we continued to see rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs in our retail pharmacies. While the long-term impacts of these drugs on customer buying habits are unknown, Kroger's 'Food as Medicine' philosophy positions us well to support our customers' health and wellness goals. Our comprehensive approach includes healthcare services, professional dietitians, and proprietary tools like our nutrition rating app, OptUP, which are all designed to support healthy living and to do so holistically. While we pride ourselves on data and insights, the patient data in our pharmacy operations is separate from our customer loyalty data and is protected by privacy laws. We are committed to using our data in an appropriate manner while not jeopardizing customers' trust. For now, we have not seen any major macro shifts in customer eating habits or spending behaviors. Food trends are constantly evolving, and we are committed to offering products that meet our customers' needs. For customers looking to adopt healthier habits with or without the help of these drugs, we are well-positioned to provide important healthcare services and healthy food options. At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, and I'm so impressed by the many ways our associates bring this to life every day in the ways they support our customers and each other. We know when associates are connected to our purpose, they feel connected to Kroger. Our annual Kroger Wellness Festival is just one example of living our purpose. This festival is one of the nation's largest health and wellness events, showcasing more than a 150 experiences and food offerings. Sponsors and celebrities joined Kroger in hundreds of thousands of visitors to share our vision for better physical, mental, and emotional health for families. It was wonderful to see the level of support and participation in this important mission. Also this quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which highlighted Kroger's significant progress on our 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' journey to expand access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food, and to reduce waste, especially food waste, across our footprint. Since we launched 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' in 2017, Kroger has donated more than 3 billion meals to feed hungry families, including more than 1.3 billion to fight food insecurity and nearly 600 million pounds of surplus food to our food bank partners. I am so proud of our teams and their efforts to reach these incredible milestones. Our associates are the driving force behind our success by delivering an outstanding customer experience and helping make the holidays even more special for our customers. We facilitate this through our long-standing commitment to invest in associate wages and benefits and training tools to advance their career growth. Feed Your Future, our continuing education benefit, is one of the important ways we make Kroger a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. This benefit provides up to $21,000 lifeline, and it's helped almost 6,000 associates this year alone, with approximately 90% of these participants being hourly. Our focus on development is contributing to strong improvements in retention, which includes associate continuity and a more consistent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are allowing Kroger to navigate a challenged environment, characterized by tightening consumer spending and food-at-home disinflation. We achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% this quarter, while also providing greater value for our customers, higher wages for our associates, and investing in strategic initiatives that will support future growth. This was made possible by our teams delivering strong performances across our margin expansion initiatives, fuel, alternative profit businesses, and health and wellness. Our year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023, building on record results over the prior three years. I'll now provide more detail on our third quarter. Identical sales without fuel decreased 0.6%. Underlying growth would have been positive 1% adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first two quarters of the year, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel and a negative effect on the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall net effect on operating profit was slightly positive. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle the impact of Express Scripts at the start of the new calendar year. Turning back to identical sales without fuel. As Rodney shared earlier, our seamless ecosystem is a critical component of our growth strategy, building customer loyalty and fueling our alternative profit businesses. Digital sales were a highlight in the quarter, growing 11%. Our overall sales continue to be affected by industry-wide disinflation. Inflation ended quarter three in the low-single digits, approximately 270 basis points lower than the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw inflation decline at a slower pace, and we would expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining positive at the year-end. Encouragingly, units have shown signs of improvement as inflation has decelerated, and we have sequentially improved units for four straight quarters. However, unit growth rates have lagged the rate of inflation decline and have not improved at the pace we would have expected. As a team, we are laser-focused on returning to unit growth and expect improvement in volumes to continue for the balance of the year. Gross margin was 22% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel increased 3 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we increased investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, and we were able to successfully fund these investments by continuing to execute our long-term margin improvement plan, including Our Brands optimization, sourcing efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Shrink was a headwind to gross margin during the quarter, primarily due to the continued rise in industry-wide theft and organized retail crime. We are investing in initiatives to mitigate shrink and protect our associates and customers in our stores. Looking ahead, we would expect these same factors that influence gross margin in quarter three will drive a similar outcome for gross margin rate in the fourth quarter. During quarter three, we recorded a LIFO charge of $29 million compared to a charge of $152 million for the same quarter last year. This reduction was due to inflation returning to low-single digits compared to double-digit growth experienced last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 32 basis points excluding fuel and adjustment items. The increase in OG&A rate was driven by planned investments in associate wages and benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. During the quarter, we also made the decision to invest in a number of strategic initiatives that are expected to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Investments were partially offset by execution of cost saving initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. We are confident in our ability to effectively manage costs and continue to deliver savings by eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience. We continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities across the business and remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. In the fourth quarter, we would expect our OG&A rate to be relatively flat compared to last year. Kroger Health is an important component of our value creation model and is delivering profitable growth in 2023. During the quarter, the team exceeded our internal goal for the number of vaccinations administered, and the higher profit margins associated with these vaccines helped offset the negative impact on margin rate from growth in GLP-1 drugs. As Rodney shared earlier, we are excited about the momentum in health and wellness, and see significant potential for future profitable growth in this area of our business. Fuel is also a key part of our strategy and through our rewards program is another way that we deliver value for customers and increase loyalty. Our fuel team did an outstanding job delivering results that were ahead of expectations in the third quarter. Our customers saved 14% more in rewards per fuel purchase compared to last year, which led to gallon sales outpacing the industry. The average retail price of fuel was $3.77 this quarter versus $3.84 last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.57 this quarter versus $0.50 last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. Kroger has made substantial investments over the last five years in our associates, raising the average hourly wage by more than 33%. We remain committed to supporting our associates with sustainable investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that will, at the same time, allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities that we serve. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drug, Dallas Meat and four stores in Roundy's, in total covering more than 19,000 associates. We have now ratified all agreements that were scheduled for negotiation in 2023. Turning to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and the disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4, which remains well below our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.3 to 2.5. This positions us well to execute our financing strategy to close the proposed merger with Albertsons early in 2024 and then quickly return to within our target leverage range post-merger. As I wrap up my comments on the quarter, let me provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Today, we updated our full-year guidance to reflect the impact of near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation. We now expect full-year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1%, and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023. Our latest sales trends would put us on track to achieve the midpoint of our updated annual sales guidance range. Importantly, we would expect to exit quarter four with a stronger sales trend than our overall results for the quarter as we start to cycle the effect of Express Scripts in January. We believe we are well-positioned to navigate near-term headwinds and the strength we are seeing in our alternative profit businesses, health and wellness and fuel, combined with a lower expected LIFO charge, gives us the confidence to raise the lower-end of our full-year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance range. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 to $4.60. And looking forward, Kroger remains committed to delivering attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with  Albertsons Companies . As of November 15, 2023, Kroger certified substantial compliance with the second request issued by the FTC. We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction. This step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement, including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S is a well-qualified buyer who meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction and will ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger. Frontline (NYSE:FRO) associates will remain employed and existing collective bargaining agreements will continue. We have made a compelling case to both Kroger and Albertsons stakeholders. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for our customers by lowering prices beginning on day one, extends our commitment to associates by increasing wages and benefits, and deepens trust with our communities by keeping stores open to assure America has access to fresh and affordable food. In terms of integration planning, we are progressing well. Our integration teams have made significant progress toward our first goal, which is to ensure continuity for associates and customers at closing. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both organizations and how we'll be able to learn from each other to provide customers with an even stronger food retail experience and compete even more effectively against larger non-union operators in the future. In closing, Kroger delivered another quarter of solid results. We are demonstrating our ability to manage through a more challenged environment and remain committed to balancing our investments in our associates and in lower prices for our customers, while continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Dean Rosenblum of Bernstein. Dean, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dean Rosenblum: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Hey, my question is really about a debate regarding the gross profit and operating profit impact of increasing digital sales. I mean, online was -- digital sales were up 11% this quarter on a total comp, ex Express Scripts of 1%, which says it's growing share. Can you help us understand -- I know you think about it in terms of the whole digital ecosystem, including the alternative revenues. But in terms of the actual operating profit contribution from digital relative to the stores, can you help us understand how to think about that as that mix continues to increase?
Rodney McMullen: If you look currently, digital would not be as profitable as stores. We do believe over time, that will change, and we think that'll change by multiple things, the overall ecosystem. If you look at the pickup, we continue to make significant progress on reducing the cost to serve a customer on pickup. If you look at our sheds, we continue to make progress on our sheds to get them to where the profitability of the shed would be the same as the store. So, if you just step back, kind of, we view job one is make sure we don't lose the customer. And what we find is that customer over time will spend more with us when they're engaged with us through pickup, delivery, and in-store. And then, obviously, if you look at the incremental profitability that is making meaningful progress, and we also, when you include media as well, that's making progress. So, if you look initially, it is not as profitable, but we have every expectations over time that it will be.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, Rodney, maybe just to add, Dean, a couple of specific data points. Can you hear me okay?
Dean Rosenblum: Yeah, please.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Dean, I think we talked, Dean, before about, we sort of bucket our digital business into two areas, the sort of the business prior to launching our CFCs, which will be pickup and delivery through our third-party providers, and then our customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado (LON:OCDO). We've talked before about the pickup and delivery business sort of having a pass-through profitability rate on incremental sales of around 5% or mid-single-digit percent and the store being sort of north of 15%. And we talked a couple of years ago about being on a journey to improving that pass-through rate through some of the things that Rodney mentioned around improving mix, around improving media revenue per transaction, and then also lowering the cost to fill a digital order. We've made good progress on all three of those areas, and we would certainly see now sort of the digital pass-through profitability heading towards that double-digit rate sort of on that journey towards getting towards parity in terms of overall profitability. And then, the Ocado CFCs, we're really still very much in the early stages of that journey where the total investment is sort of starting to peak and we're starting to see tailwinds in that profitability as we start to achieve more scale in those facilities.
Dean Rosenblum: That's great. Thanks so much, Gary. My follow-up question is, you mentioned certifying the second request substantial completion on November 15th. That would suggest that the FTC now has 30 days to either make a decision or to extend the period. Do you have any sense right now as to whether we might expect some sort of an FTC decision or that the FTC is more likely to extend the time for that decision?
Rodney McMullen: Dean, it's a great question. And if you look as you -- in our prepared comments, we expect to close in early 2024 as we have all along. We continue to have a cooperative relationship with the FTC and other interested parties, and it's still too early in terms of specific dates. Thanks, Dean.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Kessler: Hi there. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks, guys. Maybe starting with the question on your inflation or deflation outlook for 2024, what your current expectation is? And what would need to happen in the backdrop for us to see either deflation or a return to more modest inflation? And in the event that we see deflation, is there a scenario in which you can hold or still expand margins, even in that kind of backdrop?
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, thanks for the question. As you know, we'll certainly provide a lot more specific details of our outlook for 2024 when we get to our quarter four earnings in March. And we're continuing, as I'm sure many are in the market, to look at all the data points we see both internally and externally. We're probably looking at some of the same data sources that you are from the top likes of USDA and other published sources. I think our view right now, we recognize we don't have the perfect crystal ball and we'll continue to watch and evaluate how we see the outlook for next year. But overall, most of the data that we're seeing would tend to point towards more of a typical year next year for food-at-home with food-at-home inflation being in the low single-digit range. We certainly think there are different scenarios that can play out. And of course, we'll look to adapt our model as we would need to, if those were the case, but that would be the data that we're watching. And we'll certainly provide more color when we get to the March earnings and talk specifically about our 2024 views.
Rodney McMullen: And one of the things that Gary always reminds me of, if you look over the last 50 years, there's only been two years out of the last 50 where it's been negative, where there's been actual deflation in a year. And as you know, we've been able to maintain and create strong business results in all environments, whether it's inflationary or deflationary, and you just manage accordingly.
Michael Kessler: Okay, great. And then, a quick follow-up on the fuel business, which had higher-than-expected profitability. So, can you talk about what drove that? And is there any interplay, I guess, between that business and the core supermarket business, if there's any balancing of the profitability dynamics and what you're able to earn to kind of manage the P&L? Or this is being managed separately and it just happened to come in a little stronger in Q3? Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, Gary mentioned it, but we're super proud of our fuel team and the partnership with all the divisions. We had a significant increase in the amount of fuel rewards that were issued, so we really look at leveraging both of the businesses to support each other. The other thing that the fuel team has done a nice job on is making sure from an efficiency standpoint on deliveries, on procurement and all the ingredients as well. So really proud of what they've done, but it really is we leverage both sides of the business to support each other and feel really good about where that business turned out. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Montani: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on two fronts. One was just if you could discuss the overall competitive backdrop? And then, secondly, we've heard a fair amount of promotions could uptick into next year. And I guess the question on that would be, what do you see in terms of vendor support versus you all having to fund that yourselves? And then, the follow-up was just OG&A dollar growth. Is there still potential for $1 billion cost-out into '24? And what kind of dollar growth should we look for underlying in the fourth quarter?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I'll answer the competitive backdrop and promotions, and if Gary wants to add anything, he can. And then, I'll let Gary ask about -- or answer the OG&A. If you look at overall, from a competitive standpoint, the market feels very similar than what it has been for a long time. If you look at the promotional activity, CPGs are increasing their funding on promotional. And I think there's two things driving that. One is CPG is not being satisfied with their tonnage so they're increasing the amount of support. The other thing for everyone is the supply chain constraints that would have been in place a year ago and two years ago is real getting back to normal. So, people are beginning to feel comfortable on promoting again, where the worst thing that could have happened is for us or for a CPG to promote something and then not have adequate supply. So, it really is behaviors getting back to pre-COVID. And even if you look at shopping during Thanksgiving, it was really more last minute, which really reflected, if you go back and look at pre COVID, it's kind of what it was, and people getting comfortable there will be products there when they go to buy it. So both great questions, but that's really what we're seeing right now. And Gary, on the OG&A.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Rodney. So, in OG&A, I'll just maybe take a step back as well and just mention a couple of points that I talked about in the third quarter. As we looked at the third quarter going into it, we would have expected OG&A to be a little bit lower as a rate. The things that were in the plan would have been the investments in average hourly rates and increasing wages for our associates in our stores and supply chain network and also the impact of ESI, and they were very much in line with what we expected. The real differences in the third quarter were that we did make some decisions during the quarter to make some strategic investments that we believe will help set up 2024 and beyond in terms of continued revenue growth, but also additional cost savings. So, as we look at the fourth quarter, we actually believe that the trends in average hourly rate will continue, and of course, Express Scripts will continue to be a factor. But outside of that, we'd expect OG&A to be relatively flat during the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still see both a sort of tailwind from initiatives that we've launched this year that will have a run rate benefit into next year. And we still see good line of sight to continued cost savings by leveraging technology and improving efficiency, driving continued improvement in cost to serve in digital and a number of areas of the business. So, we would remain confident that we see a good line of sight to continue to find that sort of 3% to 5% productivity improvements that we target to make sure we can continue to invest in our customers and continue to invest in our associates.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John, please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with, can you talk to -- if you think about the promotional basket, proactive versus reactive on your end, right, kind of is it -- would you say, I don't know, 80% proactive, 20% reactive? I don't know how you think about that. And then, on the reactive side, it would seem that those without a loyalty program would be at a disadvantage to you and that you can see what's going on in the market and possibly respond where yours is more stealth. Is that even remotely how you run the business, right, where you can respond to others based on what you see out there?
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, John, for the question. By far, the majority, and when I say majority would be almost all would be proactive versus reactive. Now, all our teams will check prices every single week and there'll be adjustments based on that. But by far, the majority of our discounts are proactive. And some of that is what you can see in an ad. A lot of that is the things that you've mentioned in terms of direct to individual household offers. It's one of the things that we believe the reason why our loyal households continue to grow and some of those aspects is once you become a Kroger shopper, you're getting those loyal customer mailings, which will allow you to stretch your budget more. And there's also personalized offers that you can go to look at coupons and download those, and there's significant increase in those. So, when you look at -- when you shop with us, obviously, we are a promotional merchant. But when you look at the rewards that we offer between fuel rewards and other rewards and our loyal customer mailings, our basket price overall is within less than cents of our biggest competitor. It's just we go to market and offer a little different way. But it is the reason why loyal shoppers are so important to us because that's the shopper that really gets the full value equation from us.
Gary Millerchip: Rodney, maybe the one thing I would add to John's question, too, the second part would be, I think, John, it's one of the reasons why we do have additional confidence in how we can navigate through the environment is that I think as a combination of our reward program and more customers engaging digitally post COVID, it really does create the ability to channel the dollars in a way that give the customer the most impact and most value while also being able to target it rather than having to sort of peanut butter spread it across in different directions. And I think it's a different dynamic now compared to maybe five, 10 years ago in the way that we're able to personalize that value and go to market.
Rodney McMullen: You've been -- you've followed us for a long time and you would have heard us use the word cherry-pickers and really what it is trying to make sure we do is to give value to customers that are loyal to us as opposed to somebody that's just shopping a discounted item that we're not making any money on.
John Heinbockel: And then maybe as a follow-up, so it sounds like volume is slightly -- is negative, right? I don't know if it's negative 1% or a little more than that, but volume is negative. Is that fair, low single-digit? When do you think that returns to positive territory? And is that solely driven -- if you looked at the budget-conscious customers, because I know a couple of quarters ago, you broke that out. Is that negativity largely driven by that cohort?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look, volume would be slightly negative. If you look, we -- our trends have improved for four quarters in a row from a trend standpoint. That would be largely driven by the value shopper or customers on a budget. And the half full and half empty, the half empty is obviously that's being driven by that customer. Some of that's driven because of the impact from inflation. Part of it's -- or SNAP is down about 30%. The full part is the customers that are loyal, we're continuing to grow with that customer and that customer's profitability is meaningfully better than the value shopper. Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank. Krisztina, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Krisztina Katai: Hi, good morning. So Rodney, I wanted to ask you just a conceptual question on grocery sector and the level of competition, right? Because if we're thinking about it, why wouldn't the sector be more competitive as we head into 2024? The consumer remains under pressure. Some of the low end is under increased pressure. CPGs are raising their support, volumes continue to lag. So that is question one, just conceptually, why wouldn't that be the case? And secondly, how is Kroger positioned in a potentially no inflation to even deflationary backdrop relative to the base case of a normal food-at-home year of low single-digit inflation?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look at, one of the things that makes this industry a lot of fun is we always assume that the business will continue to be more competitive. And if you look at our fundamental business model over the last five years or 10 years or 15 years, every year, we assume that it's going to be more competitive. We worked really hard to identify process changes and cost reductions so that we can continue to fund wage increases and invest in lowering prices for the customer. So, when we look at 2024, and obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail early next year when we give guidance, but right now, we don't see that environment any different than what we would have felt for the last five years or 10 years or 15 years. And the positive is customers get a better value every year and they get a better experience every year. And when you look at for us, one of the things that we think is important for the customers, the customer doesn't have to compromise. So, they get amazing fresh product that will last a long time when they get at home, with amazing friendly associates, with the smile and support that everything in their basket plus a little bit an extra piece of cheese or something they've engaged with Murray, so -- and not have to compromise from a pricing standpoint. So, when you look overall, we feel very good in terms of how we're positioned with the customers that really appreciate what we offer.
Gary Millerchip: Maybe, Rodney, one thing I would just add, too, Krisztina, specific to 2024, a couple of things for Kroger that we think are helpful as we look into next year. One is, of course, that we're cycling the impact of Express Scripts when we get to January and we'll start to see that flow through in the early periods of the year. And then secondly, one of the things that we've seen, as we look at 2023, many states, as you know, reduced the amount of SNAP dollars that were available in the market, and those happened sort of around the middle part of our Q1 last year or this year, I should say. What we've seen in one or two markets where we're cycling those earlier markets where they reduced the SNAP dollars, it certainly starts to create a bit of a different trend in the growth in those markets, too. So, we do think there's, for the industry and specifically for the markets that we operate in, as you start to cycle the impact of those SNAP dollars, which perhaps had a bit more of an impact than we were originally thinking they might across the industry, that starts to create some, I think, tailwind in the industry towards next year's growth as well.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Krisztina.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Ed, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ed Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Ed Kelly: Gary, I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. I think you said that the Q4 gross margin, you expect to be flattish. If you could just confirm that. And then looking out, is the base case for '24 that, that flattish trend would continue? And then, within that context, I'm curious about shrink. And maybe just educate us a little bit on when you do your accounts, the visibility you have on where you stand in shrink, and do you believe it's peaked?
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Ed. So, the first part of the question, yes, you're essentially right that we -- I said in my prepared comments that we would expect Q4 to look very similar to Q3. The way that I sort of would break that down is that we've been equally as pleased with the progress that we've seen in the margin improvement plan initiatives that we saw in the earlier part of the year as well. So, we continue to see strong benefits from Our Brands, strong benefits from sourcing, health and wellness, of course, with Express Scripts is a tailwind this year to gross margin, and supply chain and alternative profits. All those areas continue to generate tailwinds in our gross margin rate. What we did in the third quarter is we did invest more in gross margin to balance those benefits partly in increased pricing and promotion, as Rodney mentioned earlier. And we did also increase advertising costs during the quarter as well. So, those would have been the differences quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we saw and what we would expect to continue to be a similar pattern as we think about the fourth quarter. I'd say as we look into beyond 2023, we certainly still see a lot of potential for the tailwinds that I mentioned around Our Brands sourcing, these areas where we believe that we are on a multiyear path to continue to drive improvement and drive growth. And of course, alternative profit streams continues to grow at a double-digit pace off a bigger base as well. So, I think we still have a lot of confidence in those levers. And what we're doing is making sure we're balancing the business to set ourselves up for continued sustained growth in the future. From a shrink perspective, we would still see shrink as a headwind, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I would say, it's probably somewhat less dramatic for us than maybe some of our peer group because while we have a general merchandise business that's impacted, it's less impacted than probably some of the big-box retailers, but it would still be a headwind to our gross margin rate that would have impacted the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. That headwind actually would have been less than it was in the second quarter, not dramatically, but it would have eased somewhat. So, it's still something that we have to work through and continue to offset, but we are seeing at least the trend in terms of year-over-year growth decelerate, but it would still be a headwind today because of the crime and organized retail crime factors I mentioned earlier.
Rodney McMullen: The other thing I think is important to remember is a lot of our shrink is in our fresh departments. And our fresh departments, actually, a lot of that is, you can manage it by changing processes and using technology. And our teams have done a great job actually on improving shrink in the fresh departments because of our store teams partnering with warehouse teams on processes and leveraging technology as well, and I think as a big chunk of the trend -- slight trend improvements that Gary mentioned.
Ed Kelly: Great point.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky: Rodney, could you talk a little bit about the economy's effect and inflation on your digital business, and I'm thinking particularly about customers' willingness to spend money on any delivery fees or membership fees, and also how the economy might be impacting delivery volumes and digital order volumes?
Rodney McMullen: If you look at overall -- thanks, Chuck. If you look at overall, inflation is definitely stabilizing overall. And it's -- from a customer standpoint, they appreciate the stabilization but they also know the fact that if you look at over the last two years, they've had to endure a lot of inflation. And if you look at some of the fresh departments, some of that has actually returned back to normal. But if you look at on the process side, you wouldn't see that. So, if you look at like eggs, for an example, eggs are significantly deflationary. And we'll all be happy when we get to the point where we're cycling that early next year or next year. If you look at customer behavior, it's fascinating. Customers do a lot of work to save where they want to save or feel like they need to save, so in pack size, if you look at moving to Our Brands versus some of the national brands. But if you look at membership fees and delivery fees and things like that, that business continues to grow strongly. And in fact, it was up double digits and that's what drove the 11%. I'm sure part of that, and any time I talk to a politician, I always remind them, if you look at customers on a budget, they're under a lot of strain and they're doing a lot of behavior changes. If you look at customers that are not as focused on price because inflation hasn't affected them as much, that customers' behavior is still very strong, and they're still continuing to buy big packs, continuing to buy nicer wines, Murray's Cheese, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), things like that. So, we over-index with our membership program on customers that are more mainstream and upscale, so I'm sure that's part of the reason why we're not seeing the behavior change.
Chuck Cerankosky: Okay. Thanks for that. And just real quick, you're exiting the ghost kitchen business. Any particular reason for that?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, great question. Appreciate it. We test a lot of different things, and we'll move on to the next version of it. We still think food away-from-home is a huge growth opportunity for us and we'll continue to focus on it. The ghost kitchen, the few customers that used it, loved it, but it just wasn't enough. So, it's one of those things where you move on. So thanks, Chuck.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to Kroger's digital performance, another quarter of double-digit growth. Did anything surprise you on the digital front? And just any more color in terms of what you guys are seeing delivery versus pickup?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I'll start and let Gary finish. I wouldn't call it a surprise, but it's great to see that the NPS scores, both in terms of our year-on-year from a pickup standpoint and a delivery standpoint is very strong. If you look at our shed delivery business, the repeat rate continues to be strong. So it really is the customers really appreciate that white-glove experience. So, I don't want to make it sound like we're surprised by it, but it's nice to see what we thought play out. Gary, I'll let you...
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, I think you said it well, Rodney. I think the only thing I would add, Rupesh, is that we've said before, we believe that digital is a growth engine for the company. And I think everything we continue to see gives us that belief it will continue to be an opportunity to drive deeper customer engagement and growth. And I mentioned in a comment earlier, but the thing we didn't talk about in the script was we are seeing continued improvement in profitability. So, it's helping profitable growth as well as we're lowering the cost to fill an order, driving more efficiency through technology and continuing to see media revenue growth. So that's the only piece I think that I would reinforce.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kenneth Goldman: Hi, thank you. I'll take a shot here on next year. I know you're not in a position to really give numbers and I wouldn't ask about that now, but you did talk about hopefully having low single-digit sort of normal inflation next year. You highlighted a healthy amount of productivity you expected or expecting. But you also mentioned that maybe your unit growth right now is a little bit disappointing, and you'll surely be lapping some challenging fuel margins that I imagine you won't assume will recur. So, I'm just trying to get a sense if you have maybe sluggish units, fuel comps are tough, to get to your earnings growth algo for next year, do you theoretically have to find other drivers that are better than their algo to offset those headwinds? I just want to kind of get a sense of how to think about at least some initial headwinds and tailwinds into next year, if that all makes sense.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. As you mentioned, we'll definitely share a lot more color, as you might expect, when we get to March. I think as we think about the model and just taking a bigger picture step back, we certainly believe that we've, over the last few years, built a more diverse ecosystem as a company. So, of course, food-at-home is an important part of -- the sort of -- it drives the flywheel. But as you know, we've been continuing to grow our fuel business, continue to grow health and wellness this year even with the impact of Express Groups, and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. So, we look at it more as a journey and we do believe that as we're building the strength in that ecosystem, it creates the -- a new way to generate value for our shareholders over time as we've talked about at previous investor meetings. I mean, I think some of the points you've raised would certainly be the areas where we'll be focusing on. I don't think it's a different strategy for Kroger. It's how do we continue to drive that flywheel as we think about taking cost out of our business so that we can invest more in customers and associates, continuing to drive traffic so we can continue to grow the alternative profit businesses. And we do think there's opportunity for margin improvement to continue beyond 2023, because of the initiatives we're driving around sourcing, supply chain, alternative profit streams, et cetera. So, I think from our perspective, certainly, if you were in a period where you weren't seeing sales growth for a sustained period of time because our model is built on sales growth, we'd have to look at our cost base and we'll look at our cost base in certain areas to be more productive. But we still believe that food-at-home is -- will normalize in the typical pattern that we see of that sort of 1% to 2% inflation over time and sort of 2% to 3% food-at-home growth. And we think our model is really well set up to be able to drive growth within that framework.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ken. The only other thing I would add to Gary's comment is if you look at our seamless business, we would expect that to continue to make progress as well, as I mentioned earlier. Thanks, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As you talk to your processed food and CPG partners, what are they telling you about their desire to further raise prices into next year, given your expectation that there could be typical inflation across the assortments that would necessitate that [indiscernible] prices go up? And this is against the backdrop where volumes continue to go down, you're providing more support. Why are they not rolling back prices to try and drive volume? And as part of that, given that you used your P&L to fund promotions a bit more in the third quarter, is that a sign that you are running into the limitation of the vendors willing to provide support for you to do these promotions? Thank you very much.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael. If you look at overall, they say in economics, all short statements are wrong. And you have CPGs that are all over the board in terms of their approach. Some CPGs are very willing to give up tonnage. And if they are, Our Brands will stay -- will be there for a customer to give them incredible value. And what we find is when a customer tries Our Brands, our repeat rate is incredibly high because of the quality and the value for the money. If you look in the quarter, in terms of funding, it was really done by CPGs and us. And as I mentioned earlier, CPGs were more aggressive in funding some of the promotions in the third quarter than the second quarter, and would expect that to continue. We are seeing more CPGs worrying about their tonnage growth, and I think that's part of what's driving that willingness, too. So, I appreciate the question, and thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Good morning, Rodney and Gary. Thanks for taking our questions.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Kelly Bania: I wanted to go back to the comment about building a more diverse ecosystem and talk a little bit more about alternative profit growth. I think there was a comment that, that is still growing double digits, which I think would mean around $150 million to $200 million in incremental year-over-year profit. But maybe just wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on that if that's the right ballpark. And how many more years can this business continue to grow at double-digit rate into the coming years?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I don't know that Gary and I will want to give the specifics for '24 on the alt profit since we're still going through the process. But we would expect alt profit to be a meaningful contributor of growth next year. And that's really driven by two things. One is our continued growth in our digital business, which is supporting our media business growth. And we think we're just getting started on that. If you look in the media world, your competitors are Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and then a lot of other players. And one of the things that we think transparency is so important in being able to give people good data is we think that is incredibly helpful relative to the Googles and Metas and others. So, we see a long-term opportunity to continue to grow the business there. And the specifics, I don't know that we want to get there either. And if you look at some of the other alternative profit businesses, some of those, we have wide variance of performance within the company. So, part of that growth is just driven by taking best-in-class within our own company and growing that as well. So, Kelly, I appreciate the question. And thanks, everyone, for all the questions. And as always, I'd like to take a few moments to share some comments with our associates listening in. To start, I'd like to say a huge thank you for all the hard work that you've done to make the holidays be so memorable for our customers and what you will do for the -- following the rest of the holiday season to make it equally as memorable for customers. As you know, food plays an important part in any celebration, and it provides an opportunity for people to connect and people that we love, especially with them and sharing special moments. If you had a chance to see our holiday film, you saw that idea come to life. And if you haven't seen our holiday film, you can go to YouTube to look at the full film. And it really does recognize that food connects us all. And whether that's honoring family traditions or creating new family ones, I've just been so inspired to see how our associates and our customers on sharing their videos and the unique ways they celebrate the holidays. As I said before, thank you for everything you do to create special memories for our customers every single day. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Robert Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen, and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline our discussion topics this morning. I will begin by covering the current retail environment and how the strength of Kroger's value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then, Gary will cover our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons, before we open it up for questions. Now, turning to our third quarter. Kroger's third quarter results highlight the strength and diversity of our business model in a challenged operating environment. A strong fuel performance and growth in our alternative profit businesses supported continued adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth. As consumer spending tightens, we are focused on providing customers with exceptional value by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, personalized promotions and rewards. We are growing households and increasing loyalty, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Customers are managing many economic factors that are pressuring their spending, including higher interest rates, reduced savings, and fewer government benefits, including SNAP. Although inflation is decelerating, customers are still adjusting to the impacts from eight consecutive quarters of broad and significant inflation. During the quarter, Kroger grew higher income households once again as our attractive mix of quality, value and convenience continues to drive engagement. By buying larger packs, more fresh items and more premium Our Brands products, these households are more profitable. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are actively looking for value, and our budget-conscious customers are under more significant spending pressure. We are also looking for ways to support customers with additional value, including in-store displays with everyday staples at low price points. We've seen a great response from all customers to these offers. But engagement from our budget-conscious households has been especially strong. Customers purchasing these offer items are making more trips and buying more units, not only recognizing the value with these displays, but the value across the entire store. To help more customers manage their budget, we are only deepening our commitment to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Our personalized promotions are an increasingly critical way for customers to save on items that matter most to them. We are applying analytics to Kroger's unmatched purchase data to strike the right balance between the depth and breadth of promotions. To ensure customers were able to enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, for example, we created a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person, which represents a lower price than last year. We have a long history of delivering value to our customers by providing a broad assortment of fresh foods at low prices through our unique omnichannel shopping experience. We achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of total household growth and increased loyal households even faster, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Now, I'll provide more details about how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. Starting with seamless. [Technical Difficulty] Our digital business delivered a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses. Multiple tailwinds are driving our sales momentum, including growth in both households and visits. Our new two-hour pickup service available in more than one-third of our stores also contributed to our success in the quarter. To become the online food retailer of choice, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment. Our teams improved key customer experience metrics in pickup, increasing fill rates and reducing wait times during the quarter. This resulted in an improved net promoter scores. Our customer fulfillment centers again led our delivery growth, where we continue to rapidly increase households. Our delivery customers enjoy the convenience of on-time refrigerated delivery directly to their doorstep with zero compromise on freshness, quality, and value. Turning to personalization. Investments in our personalized capabilities ensure we are meeting elevated customer demand for savings and enables us to deploy promotional dollars more effectively. Digital offers have increased compared to last year and our personalization capabilities have resulted in even more significant increase in redemptions, driving loyalty and increasing digitally-engaged households this quarter by 13%. Digitally-engaged households are incredibly valuable to our model as they are more loyal, spend nearly 3 times more with us, and accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. Now, I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model supported earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Growth in alternative profit businesses remained strong in the third quarter with balanced growth across the portfolio. The strength of our seamless ecosystem and elevated digital engagement is having a flywheel effect, creating the traffic and the data needed to drive growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, a higher-margin profit stream. Recently, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of KPM. This quarter, KPM made an important step in its journey to become the most trusted and transparent media company. By activating ad buying platforms, we are offering more self-service solutions to meet clients where they are today, providing advertisers more direct access to custom Kroger audiences. This first iteration has already launched, and KPM expects to expand to other buying platforms in the future. These new innovative features will help accelerate KPM's impressive growth by allowing advertisers to reduce waste and enhance measurement tools. Kroger Health had a strong quarter that exceeded our internal expectations and helped drive sales and profit growth. Our decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our customers and shareholders. Our teams have done an excellent job retaining patients and utilizing our pharmacists' extra capacity to devote more time to patient care, including growing our number of vaccinations. Gary will provide more on the financial impact of this later. During the quarter, we continued to see rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs in our retail pharmacies. While the long-term impacts of these drugs on customer buying habits are unknown, Kroger's 'Food as Medicine' philosophy positions us well to support our customers' health and wellness goals. Our comprehensive approach includes healthcare services, professional dietitians, and proprietary tools like our nutrition rating app, OptUP, which are all designed to support healthy living and to do so holistically. While we pride ourselves on data and insights, the patient data in our pharmacy operations is separate from our customer loyalty data and is protected by privacy laws. We are committed to using our data in an appropriate manner while not jeopardizing customers' trust. For now, we have not seen any major macro shifts in customer eating habits or spending behaviors. Food trends are constantly evolving, and we are committed to offering products that meet our customers' needs. For customers looking to adopt healthier habits with or without the help of these drugs, we are well-positioned to provide important healthcare services and healthy food options. At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, and I'm so impressed by the many ways our associates bring this to life every day in the ways they support our customers and each other. We know when associates are connected to our purpose, they feel connected to Kroger. Our annual Kroger Wellness Festival is just one example of living our purpose. This festival is one of the nation's largest health and wellness events, showcasing more than a 150 experiences and food offerings. Sponsors and celebrities joined Kroger in hundreds of thousands of visitors to share our vision for better physical, mental, and emotional health for families. It was wonderful to see the level of support and participation in this important mission. Also this quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which highlighted Kroger's significant progress on our 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' journey to expand access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food, and to reduce waste, especially food waste, across our footprint. Since we launched 'Zero Hunger Zero Waste' in 2017, Kroger has donated more than 3 billion meals to feed hungry families, including more than 1.3 billion to fight food insecurity and nearly 600 million pounds of surplus food to our food bank partners. I am so proud of our teams and their efforts to reach these incredible milestones. Our associates are the driving force behind our success by delivering an outstanding customer experience and helping make the holidays even more special for our customers. We facilitate this through our long-standing commitment to invest in associate wages and benefits and training tools to advance their career growth. Feed Your Future, our continuing education benefit, is one of the important ways we make Kroger a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. This benefit provides up to $21,000 lifeline, and it's helped almost 6,000 associates this year alone, with approximately 90% of these participants being hourly. Our focus on development is contributing to strong improvements in retention, which includes associate continuity and a more consistent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are allowing Kroger to navigate a challenged environment, characterized by tightening consumer spending and food-at-home disinflation. We achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% this quarter, while also providing greater value for our customers, higher wages for our associates, and investing in strategic initiatives that will support future growth. This was made possible by our teams delivering strong performances across our margin expansion initiatives, fuel, alternative profit businesses, and health and wellness. Our year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023, building on record results over the prior three years. I'll now provide more detail on our third quarter. Identical sales without fuel decreased 0.6%. Underlying growth would have been positive 1% adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first two quarters of the year, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel and a negative effect on the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall net effect on operating profit was slightly positive. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle the impact of Express Scripts at the start of the new calendar year. Turning back to identical sales without fuel. As Rodney shared earlier, our seamless ecosystem is a critical component of our growth strategy, building customer loyalty and fueling our alternative profit businesses. Digital sales were a highlight in the quarter, growing 11%. Our overall sales continue to be affected by industry-wide disinflation. Inflation ended quarter three in the low-single digits, approximately 270 basis points lower than the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw inflation decline at a slower pace, and we would expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining positive at the year-end. Encouragingly, units have shown signs of improvement as inflation has decelerated, and we have sequentially improved units for four straight quarters. However, unit growth rates have lagged the rate of inflation decline and have not improved at the pace we would have expected. As a team, we are laser-focused on returning to unit growth and expect improvement in volumes to continue for the balance of the year. Gross margin was 22% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel increased 3 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we increased investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, and we were able to successfully fund these investments by continuing to execute our long-term margin improvement plan, including Our Brands optimization, sourcing efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Shrink was a headwind to gross margin during the quarter, primarily due to the continued rise in industry-wide theft and organized retail crime. We are investing in initiatives to mitigate shrink and protect our associates and customers in our stores. Looking ahead, we would expect these same factors that influence gross margin in quarter three will drive a similar outcome for gross margin rate in the fourth quarter. During quarter three, we recorded a LIFO charge of $29 million compared to a charge of $152 million for the same quarter last year. This reduction was due to inflation returning to low-single digits compared to double-digit growth experienced last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 32 basis points excluding fuel and adjustment items. The increase in OG&A rate was driven by planned investments in associate wages and benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. During the quarter, we also made the decision to invest in a number of strategic initiatives that are expected to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Investments were partially offset by execution of cost saving initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. We are confident in our ability to effectively manage costs and continue to deliver savings by eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience. We continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities across the business and remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. In the fourth quarter, we would expect our OG&A rate to be relatively flat compared to last year. Kroger Health is an important component of our value creation model and is delivering profitable growth in 2023. During the quarter, the team exceeded our internal goal for the number of vaccinations administered, and the higher profit margins associated with these vaccines helped offset the negative impact on margin rate from growth in GLP-1 drugs. As Rodney shared earlier, we are excited about the momentum in health and wellness, and see significant potential for future profitable growth in this area of our business. Fuel is also a key part of our strategy and through our rewards program is another way that we deliver value for customers and increase loyalty. Our fuel team did an outstanding job delivering results that were ahead of expectations in the third quarter. Our customers saved 14% more in rewards per fuel purchase compared to last year, which led to gallon sales outpacing the industry. The average retail price of fuel was $3.77 this quarter versus $3.84 last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.57 this quarter versus $0.50 last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. Kroger has made substantial investments over the last five years in our associates, raising the average hourly wage by more than 33%. We remain committed to supporting our associates with sustainable investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that will, at the same time, allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities that we serve. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drug, Dallas Meat and four stores in Roundy's, in total covering more than 19,000 associates. We have now ratified all agreements that were scheduled for negotiation in 2023. Turning to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and the disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4, which remains well below our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.3 to 2.5. This positions us well to execute our financing strategy to close the proposed merger with Albertsons early in 2024 and then quickly return to within our target leverage range post-merger. As I wrap up my comments on the quarter, let me provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Today, we updated our full-year guidance to reflect the impact of near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation. We now expect full-year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1%, and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023. Our latest sales trends would put us on track to achieve the midpoint of our updated annual sales guidance range. Importantly, we would expect to exit quarter four with a stronger sales trend than our overall results for the quarter as we start to cycle the effect of Express Scripts in January. We believe we are well-positioned to navigate near-term headwinds and the strength we are seeing in our alternative profit businesses, health and wellness and fuel, combined with a lower expected LIFO charge, gives us the confidence to raise the lower-end of our full-year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance range. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 to $4.60. And looking forward, Kroger remains committed to delivering attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with  Albertsons Companies . As of November 15, 2023, Kroger certified substantial compliance with the second request issued by the FTC. We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction. This step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement, including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S is a well-qualified buyer who meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction and will ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger. Frontline (NYSE:FRO) associates will remain employed and existing collective bargaining agreements will continue. We have made a compelling case to both Kroger and Albertsons stakeholders. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for our customers by lowering prices beginning on day one, extends our commitment to associates by increasing wages and benefits, and deepens trust with our communities by keeping stores open to assure America has access to fresh and affordable food. In terms of integration planning, we are progressing well. Our integration teams have made significant progress toward our first goal, which is to ensure continuity for associates and customers at closing. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both organizations and how we'll be able to learn from each other to provide customers with an even stronger food retail experience and compete even more effectively against larger non-union operators in the future. In closing, Kroger delivered another quarter of solid results. We are demonstrating our ability to manage through a more challenged environment and remain committed to balancing our investments in our associates and in lower prices for our customers, while continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Dean Rosenblum of Bernstein. Dean, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dean Rosenblum: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Hey, my question is really about a debate regarding the gross profit and operating profit impact of increasing digital sales. I mean, online was -- digital sales were up 11% this quarter on a total comp, ex Express Scripts of 1%, which says it's growing share. Can you help us understand -- I know you think about it in terms of the whole digital ecosystem, including the alternative revenues. But in terms of the actual operating profit contribution from digital relative to the stores, can you help us understand how to think about that as that mix continues to increase?
Rodney McMullen: If you look currently, digital would not be as profitable as stores. We do believe over time, that will change, and we think that'll change by multiple things, the overall ecosystem. If you look at the pickup, we continue to make significant progress on reducing the cost to serve a customer on pickup. If you look at our sheds, we continue to make progress on our sheds to get them to where the profitability of the shed would be the same as the store. So, if you just step back, kind of, we view job one is make sure we don't lose the customer. And what we find is that customer over time will spend more with us when they're engaged with us through pickup, delivery, and in-store. And then, obviously, if you look at the incremental profitability that is making meaningful progress, and we also, when you include media as well, that's making progress. So, if you look initially, it is not as profitable, but we have every expectations over time that it will be.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, Rodney, maybe just to add, Dean, a couple of specific data points. Can you hear me okay?
Dean Rosenblum: Yeah, please.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Dean, I think we talked, Dean, before about, we sort of bucket our digital business into two areas, the sort of the business prior to launching our CFCs, which will be pickup and delivery through our third-party providers, and then our customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado (LON:OCDO). We've talked before about the pickup and delivery business sort of having a pass-through profitability rate on incremental sales of around 5% or mid-single-digit percent and the store being sort of north of 15%. And we talked a couple of years ago about being on a journey to improving that pass-through rate through some of the things that Rodney mentioned around improving mix, around improving media revenue per transaction, and then also lowering the cost to fill a digital order. We've made good progress on all three of those areas, and we would certainly see now sort of the digital pass-through profitability heading towards that double-digit rate sort of on that journey towards getting towards parity in terms of overall profitability. And then, the Ocado CFCs, we're really still very much in the early stages of that journey where the total investment is sort of starting to peak and we're starting to see tailwinds in that profitability as we start to achieve more scale in those facilities.
Dean Rosenblum: That's great. Thanks so much, Gary. My follow-up question is, you mentioned certifying the second request substantial completion on November 15th. That would suggest that the FTC now has 30 days to either make a decision or to extend the period. Do you have any sense right now as to whether we might expect some sort of an FTC decision or that the FTC is more likely to extend the time for that decision?
Rodney McMullen: Dean, it's a great question. And if you look as you -- in our prepared comments, we expect to close in early 2024 as we have all along. We continue to have a cooperative relationship with the FTC and other interested parties, and it's still too early in terms of specific dates. Thanks, Dean.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Kessler: Hi there. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks, guys. Maybe starting with the question on your inflation or deflation outlook for 2024, what your current expectation is? And what would need to happen in the backdrop for us to see either deflation or a return to more modest inflation? And in the event that we see deflation, is there a scenario in which you can hold or still expand margins, even in that kind of backdrop?
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, thanks for the question. As you know, we'll certainly provide a lot more specific details of our outlook for 2024 when we get to our quarter four earnings in March. And we're continuing, as I'm sure many are in the market, to look at all the data points we see both internally and externally. We're probably looking at some of the same data sources that you are from the top likes of USDA and other published sources. I think our view right now, we recognize we don't have the perfect crystal ball and we'll continue to watch and evaluate how we see the outlook for next year. But overall, most of the data that we're seeing would tend to point towards more of a typical year next year for food-at-home with food-at-home inflation being in the low single-digit range. We certainly think there are different scenarios that can play out. And of course, we'll look to adapt our model as we would need to, if those were the case, but that would be the data that we're watching. And we'll certainly provide more color when we get to the March earnings and talk specifically about our 2024 views.
Rodney McMullen: And one of the things that Gary always reminds me of, if you look over the last 50 years, there's only been two years out of the last 50 where it's been negative, where there's been actual deflation in a year. And as you know, we've been able to maintain and create strong business results in all environments, whether it's inflationary or deflationary, and you just manage accordingly.
Michael Kessler: Okay, great. And then, a quick follow-up on the fuel business, which had higher-than-expected profitability. So, can you talk about what drove that? And is there any interplay, I guess, between that business and the core supermarket business, if there's any balancing of the profitability dynamics and what you're able to earn to kind of manage the P&L? Or this is being managed separately and it just happened to come in a little stronger in Q3? Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, Gary mentioned it, but we're super proud of our fuel team and the partnership with all the divisions. We had a significant increase in the amount of fuel rewards that were issued, so we really look at leveraging both of the businesses to support each other. The other thing that the fuel team has done a nice job on is making sure from an efficiency standpoint on deliveries, on procurement and all the ingredients as well. So really proud of what they've done, but it really is we leverage both sides of the business to support each other and feel really good about where that business turned out. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Montani: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on two fronts. One was just if you could discuss the overall competitive backdrop? And then, secondly, we've heard a fair amount of promotions could uptick into next year. And I guess the question on that would be, what do you see in terms of vendor support versus you all having to fund that yourselves? And then, the follow-up was just OG&A dollar growth. Is there still potential for $1 billion cost-out into '24? And what kind of dollar growth should we look for underlying in the fourth quarter?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I'll answer the competitive backdrop and promotions, and if Gary wants to add anything, he can. And then, I'll let Gary ask about -- or answer the OG&A. If you look at overall, from a competitive standpoint, the market feels very similar than what it has been for a long time. If you look at the promotional activity, CPGs are increasing their funding on promotional. And I think there's two things driving that. One is CPG is not being satisfied with their tonnage so they're increasing the amount of support. The other thing for everyone is the supply chain constraints that would have been in place a year ago and two years ago is real getting back to normal. So, people are beginning to feel comfortable on promoting again, where the worst thing that could have happened is for us or for a CPG to promote something and then not have adequate supply. So, it really is behaviors getting back to pre-COVID. And even if you look at shopping during Thanksgiving, it was really more last minute, which really reflected, if you go back and look at pre COVID, it's kind of what it was, and people getting comfortable there will be products there when they go to buy it. So both great questions, but that's really what we're seeing right now. And Gary, on the OG&A.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Rodney. So, in OG&A, I'll just maybe take a step back as well and just mention a couple of points that I talked about in the third quarter. As we looked at the third quarter going into it, we would have expected OG&A to be a little bit lower as a rate. The things that were in the plan would have been the investments in average hourly rates and increasing wages for our associates in our stores and supply chain network and also the impact of ESI, and they were very much in line with what we expected. The real differences in the third quarter were that we did make some decisions during the quarter to make some strategic investments that we believe will help set up 2024 and beyond in terms of continued revenue growth, but also additional cost savings. So, as we look at the fourth quarter, we actually believe that the trends in average hourly rate will continue, and of course, Express Scripts will continue to be a factor. But outside of that, we'd expect OG&A to be relatively flat during the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still see both a sort of tailwind from initiatives that we've launched this year that will have a run rate benefit into next year. And we still see good line of sight to continued cost savings by leveraging technology and improving efficiency, driving continued improvement in cost to serve in digital and a number of areas of the business. So, we would remain confident that we see a good line of sight to continue to find that sort of 3% to 5% productivity improvements that we target to make sure we can continue to invest in our customers and continue to invest in our associates.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John, please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with, can you talk to -- if you think about the promotional basket, proactive versus reactive on your end, right, kind of is it -- would you say, I don't know, 80% proactive, 20% reactive? I don't know how you think about that. And then, on the reactive side, it would seem that those without a loyalty program would be at a disadvantage to you and that you can see what's going on in the market and possibly respond where yours is more stealth. Is that even remotely how you run the business, right, where you can respond to others based on what you see out there?
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, John, for the question. By far, the majority, and when I say majority would be almost all would be proactive versus reactive. Now, all our teams will check prices every single week and there'll be adjustments based on that. But by far, the majority of our discounts are proactive. And some of that is what you can see in an ad. A lot of that is the things that you've mentioned in terms of direct to individual household offers. It's one of the things that we believe the reason why our loyal households continue to grow and some of those aspects is once you become a Kroger shopper, you're getting those loyal customer mailings, which will allow you to stretch your budget more. And there's also personalized offers that you can go to look at coupons and download those, and there's significant increase in those. So, when you look at -- when you shop with us, obviously, we are a promotional merchant. But when you look at the rewards that we offer between fuel rewards and other rewards and our loyal customer mailings, our basket price overall is within less than cents of our biggest competitor. It's just we go to market and offer a little different way. But it is the reason why loyal shoppers are so important to us because that's the shopper that really gets the full value equation from us.
Gary Millerchip: Rodney, maybe the one thing I would add to John's question, too, the second part would be, I think, John, it's one of the reasons why we do have additional confidence in how we can navigate through the environment is that I think as a combination of our reward program and more customers engaging digitally post COVID, it really does create the ability to channel the dollars in a way that give the customer the most impact and most value while also being able to target it rather than having to sort of peanut butter spread it across in different directions. And I think it's a different dynamic now compared to maybe five, 10 years ago in the way that we're able to personalize that value and go to market.
Rodney McMullen: You've been -- you've followed us for a long time and you would have heard us use the word cherry-pickers and really what it is trying to make sure we do is to give value to customers that are loyal to us as opposed to somebody that's just shopping a discounted item that we're not making any money on.
John Heinbockel: And then maybe as a follow-up, so it sounds like volume is slightly -- is negative, right? I don't know if it's negative 1% or a little more than that, but volume is negative. Is that fair, low single-digit? When do you think that returns to positive territory? And is that solely driven -- if you looked at the budget-conscious customers, because I know a couple of quarters ago, you broke that out. Is that negativity largely driven by that cohort?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look, volume would be slightly negative. If you look, we -- our trends have improved for four quarters in a row from a trend standpoint. That would be largely driven by the value shopper or customers on a budget. And the half full and half empty, the half empty is obviously that's being driven by that customer. Some of that's driven because of the impact from inflation. Part of it's -- or SNAP is down about 30%. The full part is the customers that are loyal, we're continuing to grow with that customer and that customer's profitability is meaningfully better than the value shopper. Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank. Krisztina, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Krisztina Katai: Hi, good morning. So Rodney, I wanted to ask you just a conceptual question on grocery sector and the level of competition, right? Because if we're thinking about it, why wouldn't the sector be more competitive as we head into 2024? The consumer remains under pressure. Some of the low end is under increased pressure. CPGs are raising their support, volumes continue to lag. So that is question one, just conceptually, why wouldn't that be the case? And secondly, how is Kroger positioned in a potentially no inflation to even deflationary backdrop relative to the base case of a normal food-at-home year of low single-digit inflation?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look at, one of the things that makes this industry a lot of fun is we always assume that the business will continue to be more competitive. And if you look at our fundamental business model over the last five years or 10 years or 15 years, every year, we assume that it's going to be more competitive. We worked really hard to identify process changes and cost reductions so that we can continue to fund wage increases and invest in lowering prices for the customer. So, when we look at 2024, and obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail early next year when we give guidance, but right now, we don't see that environment any different than what we would have felt for the last five years or 10 years or 15 years. And the positive is customers get a better value every year and they get a better experience every year. And when you look at for us, one of the things that we think is important for the customers, the customer doesn't have to compromise. So, they get amazing fresh product that will last a long time when they get at home, with amazing friendly associates, with the smile and support that everything in their basket plus a little bit an extra piece of cheese or something they've engaged with Murray, so -- and not have to compromise from a pricing standpoint. So, when you look overall, we feel very good in terms of how we're positioned with the customers that really appreciate what we offer.
Gary Millerchip: Maybe, Rodney, one thing I would just add, too, Krisztina, specific to 2024, a couple of things for Kroger that we think are helpful as we look into next year. One is, of course, that we're cycling the impact of Express Scripts when we get to January and we'll start to see that flow through in the early periods of the year. And then secondly, one of the things that we've seen, as we look at 2023, many states, as you know, reduced the amount of SNAP dollars that were available in the market, and those happened sort of around the middle part of our Q1 last year or this year, I should say. What we've seen in one or two markets where we're cycling those earlier markets where they reduced the SNAP dollars, it certainly starts to create a bit of a different trend in the growth in those markets, too. So, we do think there's, for the industry and specifically for the markets that we operate in, as you start to cycle the impact of those SNAP dollars, which perhaps had a bit more of an impact than we were originally thinking they might across the industry, that starts to create some, I think, tailwind in the industry towards next year's growth as well.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Krisztina.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Ed, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ed Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Ed Kelly: Gary, I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. I think you said that the Q4 gross margin, you expect to be flattish. If you could just confirm that. And then looking out, is the base case for '24 that, that flattish trend would continue? And then, within that context, I'm curious about shrink. And maybe just educate us a little bit on when you do your accounts, the visibility you have on where you stand in shrink, and do you believe it's peaked?
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Ed. So, the first part of the question, yes, you're essentially right that we -- I said in my prepared comments that we would expect Q4 to look very similar to Q3. The way that I sort of would break that down is that we've been equally as pleased with the progress that we've seen in the margin improvement plan initiatives that we saw in the earlier part of the year as well. So, we continue to see strong benefits from Our Brands, strong benefits from sourcing, health and wellness, of course, with Express Scripts is a tailwind this year to gross margin, and supply chain and alternative profits. All those areas continue to generate tailwinds in our gross margin rate. What we did in the third quarter is we did invest more in gross margin to balance those benefits partly in increased pricing and promotion, as Rodney mentioned earlier. And we did also increase advertising costs during the quarter as well. So, those would have been the differences quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we saw and what we would expect to continue to be a similar pattern as we think about the fourth quarter. I'd say as we look into beyond 2023, we certainly still see a lot of potential for the tailwinds that I mentioned around Our Brands sourcing, these areas where we believe that we are on a multiyear path to continue to drive improvement and drive growth. And of course, alternative profit streams continues to grow at a double-digit pace off a bigger base as well. So, I think we still have a lot of confidence in those levers. And what we're doing is making sure we're balancing the business to set ourselves up for continued sustained growth in the future. From a shrink perspective, we would still see shrink as a headwind, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I would say, it's probably somewhat less dramatic for us than maybe some of our peer group because while we have a general merchandise business that's impacted, it's less impacted than probably some of the big-box retailers, but it would still be a headwind to our gross margin rate that would have impacted the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. That headwind actually would have been less than it was in the second quarter, not dramatically, but it would have eased somewhat. So, it's still something that we have to work through and continue to offset, but we are seeing at least the trend in terms of year-over-year growth decelerate, but it would still be a headwind today because of the crime and organized retail crime factors I mentioned earlier.
Rodney McMullen: The other thing I think is important to remember is a lot of our shrink is in our fresh departments. And our fresh departments, actually, a lot of that is, you can manage it by changing processes and using technology. And our teams have done a great job actually on improving shrink in the fresh departments because of our store teams partnering with warehouse teams on processes and leveraging technology as well, and I think as a big chunk of the trend -- slight trend improvements that Gary mentioned.
Ed Kelly: Great point.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky: Rodney, could you talk a little bit about the economy's effect and inflation on your digital business, and I'm thinking particularly about customers' willingness to spend money on any delivery fees or membership fees, and also how the economy might be impacting delivery volumes and digital order volumes?
Rodney McMullen: If you look at overall -- thanks, Chuck. If you look at overall, inflation is definitely stabilizing overall. And it's -- from a customer standpoint, they appreciate the stabilization but they also know the fact that if you look at over the last two years, they've had to endure a lot of inflation. And if you look at some of the fresh departments, some of that has actually returned back to normal. But if you look at on the process side, you wouldn't see that. So, if you look at like eggs, for an example, eggs are significantly deflationary. And we'll all be happy when we get to the point where we're cycling that early next year or next year. If you look at customer behavior, it's fascinating. Customers do a lot of work to save where they want to save or feel like they need to save, so in pack size, if you look at moving to Our Brands versus some of the national brands. But if you look at membership fees and delivery fees and things like that, that business continues to grow strongly. And in fact, it was up double digits and that's what drove the 11%. I'm sure part of that, and any time I talk to a politician, I always remind them, if you look at customers on a budget, they're under a lot of strain and they're doing a lot of behavior changes. If you look at customers that are not as focused on price because inflation hasn't affected them as much, that customers' behavior is still very strong, and they're still continuing to buy big packs, continuing to buy nicer wines, Murray's Cheese, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), things like that. So, we over-index with our membership program on customers that are more mainstream and upscale, so I'm sure that's part of the reason why we're not seeing the behavior change.
Chuck Cerankosky: Okay. Thanks for that. And just real quick, you're exiting the ghost kitchen business. Any particular reason for that?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, great question. Appreciate it. We test a lot of different things, and we'll move on to the next version of it. We still think food away-from-home is a huge growth opportunity for us and we'll continue to focus on it. The ghost kitchen, the few customers that used it, loved it, but it just wasn't enough. So, it's one of those things where you move on. So thanks, Chuck.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to Kroger's digital performance, another quarter of double-digit growth. Did anything surprise you on the digital front? And just any more color in terms of what you guys are seeing delivery versus pickup?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I'll start and let Gary finish. I wouldn't call it a surprise, but it's great to see that the NPS scores, both in terms of our year-on-year from a pickup standpoint and a delivery standpoint is very strong. If you look at our shed delivery business, the repeat rate continues to be strong. So it really is the customers really appreciate that white-glove experience. So, I don't want to make it sound like we're surprised by it, but it's nice to see what we thought play out. Gary, I'll let you...
Gary Millerchip: Yeah, I think you said it well, Rodney. I think the only thing I would add, Rupesh, is that we've said before, we believe that digital is a growth engine for the company. And I think everything we continue to see gives us that belief it will continue to be an opportunity to drive deeper customer engagement and growth. And I mentioned in a comment earlier, but the thing we didn't talk about in the script was we are seeing continued improvement in profitability. So, it's helping profitable growth as well as we're lowering the cost to fill an order, driving more efficiency through technology and continuing to see media revenue growth. So that's the only piece I think that I would reinforce.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kenneth Goldman: Hi, thank you. I'll take a shot here on next year. I know you're not in a position to really give numbers and I wouldn't ask about that now, but you did talk about hopefully having low single-digit sort of normal inflation next year. You highlighted a healthy amount of productivity you expected or expecting. But you also mentioned that maybe your unit growth right now is a little bit disappointing, and you'll surely be lapping some challenging fuel margins that I imagine you won't assume will recur. So, I'm just trying to get a sense if you have maybe sluggish units, fuel comps are tough, to get to your earnings growth algo for next year, do you theoretically have to find other drivers that are better than their algo to offset those headwinds? I just want to kind of get a sense of how to think about at least some initial headwinds and tailwinds into next year, if that all makes sense.
Gary Millerchip: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. As you mentioned, we'll definitely share a lot more color, as you might expect, when we get to March. I think as we think about the model and just taking a bigger picture step back, we certainly believe that we've, over the last few years, built a more diverse ecosystem as a company. So, of course, food-at-home is an important part of -- the sort of -- it drives the flywheel. But as you know, we've been continuing to grow our fuel business, continue to grow health and wellness this year even with the impact of Express Groups, and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. So, we look at it more as a journey and we do believe that as we're building the strength in that ecosystem, it creates the -- a new way to generate value for our shareholders over time as we've talked about at previous investor meetings. I mean, I think some of the points you've raised would certainly be the areas where we'll be focusing on. I don't think it's a different strategy for Kroger. It's how do we continue to drive that flywheel as we think about taking cost out of our business so that we can invest more in customers and associates, continuing to drive traffic so we can continue to grow the alternative profit businesses. And we do think there's opportunity for margin improvement to continue beyond 2023, because of the initiatives we're driving around sourcing, supply chain, alternative profit streams, et cetera. So, I think from our perspective, certainly, if you were in a period where you weren't seeing sales growth for a sustained period of time because our model is built on sales growth, we'd have to look at our cost base and we'll look at our cost base in certain areas to be more productive. But we still believe that food-at-home is -- will normalize in the typical pattern that we see of that sort of 1% to 2% inflation over time and sort of 2% to 3% food-at-home growth. And we think our model is really well set up to be able to drive growth within that framework.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ken. The only other thing I would add to Gary's comment is if you look at our seamless business, we would expect that to continue to make progress as well, as I mentioned earlier. Thanks, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As you talk to your processed food and CPG partners, what are they telling you about their desire to further raise prices into next year, given your expectation that there could be typical inflation across the assortments that would necessitate that [indiscernible] prices go up? And this is against the backdrop where volumes continue to go down, you're providing more support. Why are they not rolling back prices to try and drive volume? And as part of that, given that you used your P&L to fund promotions a bit more in the third quarter, is that a sign that you are running into the limitation of the vendors willing to provide support for you to do these promotions? Thank you very much.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael. If you look at overall, they say in economics, all short statements are wrong. And you have CPGs that are all over the board in terms of their approach. Some CPGs are very willing to give up tonnage. And if they are, Our Brands will stay -- will be there for a customer to give them incredible value. And what we find is when a customer tries Our Brands, our repeat rate is incredibly high because of the quality and the value for the money. If you look in the quarter, in terms of funding, it was really done by CPGs and us. And as I mentioned earlier, CPGs were more aggressive in funding some of the promotions in the third quarter than the second quarter, and would expect that to continue. We are seeing more CPGs worrying about their tonnage growth, and I think that's part of what's driving that willingness, too. So, I appreciate the question, and thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Good morning, Rodney and Gary. Thanks for taking our questions.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Kelly Bania: I wanted to go back to the comment about building a more diverse ecosystem and talk a little bit more about alternative profit growth. I think there was a comment that, that is still growing double digits, which I think would mean around $150 million to $200 million in incremental year-over-year profit. But maybe just wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on that if that's the right ballpark. And how many more years can this business continue to grow at double-digit rate into the coming years?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I don't know that Gary and I will want to give the specifics for '24 on the alt profit since we're still going through the process. But we would expect alt profit to be a meaningful contributor of growth next year. And that's really driven by two things. One is our continued growth in our digital business, which is supporting our media business growth. And we think we're just getting started on that. If you look in the media world, your competitors are Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and then a lot of other players. And one of the things that we think transparency is so important in being able to give people good data is we think that is incredibly helpful relative to the Googles and Metas and others. So, we see a long-term opportunity to continue to grow the business there. And the specifics, I don't know that we want to get there either. And if you look at some of the other alternative profit businesses, some of those, we have wide variance of performance within the company. So, part of that growth is just driven by taking best-in-class within our own company and growing that as well. So, Kelly, I appreciate the question. And thanks, everyone, for all the questions. And as always, I'd like to take a few moments to share some comments with our associates listening in. To start, I'd like to say a huge thank you for all the hard work that you've done to make the holidays be so memorable for our customers and what you will do for the -- following the rest of the holiday season to make it equally as memorable for customers. As you know, food plays an important part in any celebration, and it provides an opportunity for people to connect and people that we love, especially with them and sharing special moments. If you had a chance to see our holiday film, you saw that idea come to life. And if you haven't seen our holiday film, you can go to YouTube to look at the full film. And it really does recognize that food connects us all. And whether that's honoring family traditions or creating new family ones, I've just been so inspired to see how our associates and our customers on sharing their videos and the unique ways they celebrate the holidays. As I said before, thank you for everything you do to create special memories for our customers every single day. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/report-mobile-apps-mainly-familiar-ones-dominate-digital-media-time-522647,"Aug 25, 2017","Mobile apps are still leading the way among consumers' digital consumption, but they're tending to stick with ones they know and already have, according to a new comScore report.
Some 57% of consumers' digital media time is taking place in mobile apps, according to comScore's 2017 U.S. Mobile Apps report, but a majority of consumers download zero apps per month.
That 57% activity in mobile apps breaks down as 50% in smartphone apps and 7% in tablet apps. Meanwhile, desktop accounts for 34% of time and mobile Web 9%.
Meanwhile, not only are younger users skewing the curve on mobile-apps time spent (those 18-24 are spending 3 hours a day in apps, vs. 2.6 hours for 25-34, and 2.3 hours for 35-44), they're the ones who are downloading new apps. Of those 18-34, 70% say they're always looking for new apps and they're willing to pay for them.
Just over 50% of all users don't download new apps, and 66% of users buy zero paid apps per month.
The takeaway may be that well-established apps from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are enough for most people, while younger users are keeping alive apps like Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) that aren't finding traction with older users at all.

The launch was seen critical for the company, particularly after the poor response to Windows 8, an ambitious redesign that confused many users by ditching the start button menu and introducing a new layout. The new OS, launched on Wednesday, will be available as a free upgrade for users of Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.  Wall Street Journal's Geoffrey Fowler said Windows 10 fixes most of the issues with Windows 8 and improves on Windows 7, Microsoft's most popular OS in recent years. For one, the start button is back. ""Three months of testing Windows 10 determined that this familiar yet fresh overhaul far outweighs any problems,"" Fowler wrote in his review.  By offering free upgrades, Microsoft aims to put the system on as many devices as possible. The company would then make up for any lost revenue by selling services such as Office over the Internet, or cloud. FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said the cloud strategy could generate a new revenue stream. ""It's a step in the right direction. They went back to their core DNA around software and a cloud-centric model and ultimately Windows as a service, a subscription model,"" Ives told Reuters. Microsoft, which unveiled Windows 10 in September, skipped Windows 9 altogether, to put some distance between the new system and Windows 8. At least one prominent reviewer was skeptical, saying the new OS was unlikely to boost PC sales or salvage Microsoft's Windows phone business. Re/code's Walt Mossberg said some features were promising but the new OS was ""surprisingly buggy"". ""I doubt it will convert many Mac owners, spur a shopping spree in new PCs, bring in droves of new developers, or save the Windows Phone,"" Mossberg wrote.  Almost all critics lauded the return of the Start button.  ""I can't start a review of Windows 10 without heralding the return of the Start menu,"" USA Today's Edward Baig wrote ""The newly revamped Start menu in Windows 10 is a useful combination of Windows past and present and a metaphor for the entire direction of Windows 10,"" .

The OECD talks involve over 100 countries on a major rewrite of global tax rules to bring them up to date for the digital era, but they have so far not produced results as the negotiations have been complicated by the coronavirus pandemic. ""The almost century-old system we still use today was not designed with today's increasingly digital economy in mind and it should be improved,"" Airbnb said in a statement backing the OECD talks. ""We believe that for a global tax system to work effectively and efficiently, it needs to be truly global, consistently applied across borders, and simple to comply with.""  The EU and Britain view digital service taxes as a way to raise revenue from the local operations of big tech companies which they say profit enormously from local markets while making only limited contributions to public coffers.

https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/new-'bash'-software-bug-may-pose-bigger-threat-than-'heartbleed'-310688,"Sep 24, 2014","By Jim Finkle  BOSTON (Reuters) - A newly discovered security bug in a widely used piece of Linux software, known as ""Bash,"" could pose a bigger threat to computer users than the ""Heartbleed"" bug that surfaced in April, cyber experts warned on Wednesday.  Bash is the software used to control the command prompt on many Unix computers. Hackers can exploit a bug in Bash to take complete control of a targeted system, security experts said.  The Department of Homeland Security's United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or US-CERT, issued an alert saying the vulnerability affected Unix-based operating systems including Linux and Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) Mac OS X.  The ""Heartbleed"" bug allowed hackers to spy on computers but not take control of them, according to Dan Guido, chief executive of a cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits.  ""The method of exploiting this issue is also far simpler. You can just cut and paste a line of code and get good results.""  Tod Beardsley, an engineering manager at cybersecurity firm Rapid7, warned the bug was rated a ""10"" for severity, meaning it has maximum impact, and rated ""low"" for complexity of exploitation, meaning it is relatively easy for hackers to launch attacks.  ""Using this vulnerability, attackers can potentially take over the operating system, access confidential information, make changes, et cetera,"" Beardsley said. ""Anybody with systems using Bash needs to deploy the patch immediately.""   US-CERT advised computer users to obtain operating systems updates from software makers. It said that Linux providers including Red Hat Inc (N:RHT) had already prepared them, but it did not mention an update for OS X. Apple representatives could not be reached.  Tavis Ormandy, a Google Inc (O:GOOG) security researcher, said via Twitter that the patches seemed ""incomplete."" Ormandy could not be reached to elaborate, but several security experts said a brief technical comment provided on Twitter raised concerns.  ""That means some systems could be exploited even though they are patched,"" said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer with security software maker Veracode.  He said corporate security teams had spent the day combing their networks to find vulnerable machines and patch them, and they would likely be taking other precautions to mitigate the potential for attacks in case the patches proved ineffective.  ""Everybody is scrambling to patch all of their Internet-facing Linux machines. That is what we did at Veracode today,"" he said. ""It could take a long time to get that done for very large organizations with complex networks.""  ""Heartbleed,"" discovered in April, is a bug in an open-source encryption software called OpenSSL. The bug put the data of millions of people at risk as OpenSSL is used in about two-thirds of all websites. It also forced dozens of technology companies to issue security patches for hundreds of products that use OpenSSL.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged more than 6% as Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said the chip maker has a ""significant opportunity"" to benefit from the uptick in demand from cloud gaming chips.
Moore said he was ""surprised"" that AMD was able to play its way into securing a part of Google's upcoming cloud-based gaming services as the chip maker's graphics technology is not as cutting edge compared to those of its rivals, including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). (NVIDIA shares were up more than 4% today.)
""We continue to be impressed by AMD’s progress at using innovative approaches to expand its markets in all segments,"" Moore added.
The upbeat outlook on AMD comes as Google is expected to announce a new streaming, cloud-based gaming service during a keynote presentation at 1 pm ET today, at the 2019 Game Developers Conference, which got underway on Monday in San Francisco.
In the run-up to the Game Developers Conference, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has made little secret of its ambitious goals in gaming, promising to unveil a ""vision for the future of gaming.""
But Moore was reluctant to upgrade his outlook on AMD's stock, which has gotten ""ahead of itself."" The shares were up 26% year-to-date through Monday. If today's gains hold, the gain would jump to 34%.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has racked up gains of more than 20% since the turn of the year, topping the S&P 500's nearly 14% advance. But all eyes will be on Micron Technology's earnings, which will serve as a gauge of whether the broader rally in semis is too hot too soon or at its infancy.
Some analysts on Wall Street have turned bearish on Micron (NASDAQ:MU) ahead of its quarterly report due Wednesday after markets close.
Rosenblatt Securities said the chipmaker still faces ""challenging"" conditions for its memory chips. The firm cut its earnings and revenue expectations for AMD both for the second quarter and full-year of 2019 and 2020.

Using what is called a ""man-in-the-middle"" (MITM) attack, the hackers interposed their own website between users and Apple's iCloud server, intercepting data and potentially gaining access to passwords, iMessages, photos and contacts, Greatfire.org wrote in its blog post.  An Apple representative declined comment on the allegations that Beijing was trying to spy on Apple customers, but noted that the company had updated its technical support page to provide advice on how to protect against such attacks.  ""We're aware of intermittent organized network attacks using insecure certificates to obtain user information, and we take this very seriously,"" the page read.  Apple tells users to never enter their iCloud password if they get warnings about invalid digital certificates when visiting www.icloud.com. It also describes procedures users can use to verify they are connected to Apple's legitimate site when using various browsers.  Greatfire.org, which conducts research on Chinese Internet censorship, alleged government involvement in the attack, saying it resembled previous attacks on Google Inc (O:GOOG), Yahoo Inc (O:YHOO) and Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) Hotmail.  Asked about the attack, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing that Beijing was ""resolutely opposed"" to hacking.  The attack cited by Greatfire comes several weeks after Apple said it would begin storing iCloud data for Chinese users on China Telecom (HK:0728) servers.  It also coincided with the start of iPhone 6 sales in China, which began Friday after weeks of talks between China and Apple over what the government said were cybersecurity concerns.  Two independent security experts contacted by Reuters said Greatfire's report appeared credible.  ""All the evidence I've seen would support that this is a real attack,"" said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at security software developer F-Secure.  Greatfire.org said the attack most likely could not have been staged without knowledge of Internet providers like China Telecom, given they appeared to originate from ""deep within the Chinese domestic Internet backbone"".  But the group said the attack may not be linked to Apple's recent decision to store user data on China Telecom servers.  It was unclear if the hackers were still active. Apple did not have an immediate comment when contacted.  A China Telecom spokesman said: ""The accusation is untrue and unfounded.""  
Apple said at the time the move to China Telecom was made to improve the speed of service for Chinese servers and flatly denied the possibility that it would expose user data.

"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tesla,-others-seek-ways-to-ensure-drivers-keep-their-hands-on-the-wheel-498781","Jun 23, 2017","By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Automakers are using tiny cameras, sensors to track drooping heads, steering wheel monitors and audible alerts to ensure drivers pay attention when using advanced driver assistance systems, like Tesla’s Autopilot, that allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel. In a report this week on the May 2016 crash of a Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Model S that killed a driver who was using Autopilot, the National Transportation Safety Board demonstrated that users could mostly keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods despite repeated warnings from the vehicle. But the crash underscored a vexing problem for automakers that want to gain an edge by launching technology that completely automates driving tasks. Unless a car is capable of driving itself safely in every situation, drivers will still have to remain alert and ready to take control even if the car is piloting itself.  The NTSB, the federal agency charged with investigating significant transportation accidents, said during a 37-minute section of the 41-minute Tesla trip, the driver kept his hands on the wheel for just 25 seconds, putting his hands on the wheel for one- to- three second increments after getting repeated visual and audible warnings. General Motors Co (N:GM) delayed introduction of a driver assistance technology called Super Cruise that was initially planned for late last year because it said it was not ready. The technology will go on sale this fall.  Barry Walkup, chief engineer of Super Cruise, said the company added ""a driver attention function, to insist on driver supervision."" The system uses a small camera that focuses on the driver and works with infrared lights to track head position to determine where the driver is looking. If the system - which uses facial recognition software - detects the driver is not paying attention, it will prompt the driver to return attention to the road. If the driver does not respond, it will escalate alerts, including a steering wheel light bar, visual indicators, tactile alerts in the seat and audible alerts. If the driver does not respond, the vehicle is brought to a controlled stop. Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) luxury Audi unit has a system that handles steering and braking at speeds of up to 40 miles. The system requires the driver to check in with the steering wheel every 15 seconds. Audi said the system will beep alerts at the driver, and if the driver does not respond, it will bring the vehicle to a stop. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is the lead agency for regulating self-driving cars, does not test or preapprove driver assistance systems before automakers install them. Instead, the agency responds to complaints or crashes when it investigates whether a potential defect poses an unreasonable risk to driver safety. The May 2016 Tesla accident has raised concerns about the regulation of self-driving cars. The NTSB will issue probable cause findings and may make recommendations to the NHTSA in the Tesla crash but does not plan to hold a public hearing on the incident, spokesman Keith Holloway said.  In September 2016, Tesla unveiled new restrictions on Autopilot after widespread concerns the system lulled users into a false sense of security through its ""hands-off"" driving capability. The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car. The car sounds warnings if drivers take their hands off the wheel for more than a minute at speeds above 45 miles per hour (72 kph) when there is no vehicle ahead, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk told reporters in September. If the driver ignores three audible warnings in an hour, the system temporarily shuts off until it is parked. Musk said at the time that autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users of the system, saying some users got as many as 10 warnings in an hour under the prior system. “It's not the neophytes, it's the experts. They get very comfortable with it and repeatedly ignore the car's warnings and in effect it becomes like a reflex action,” Musk said. Tesla monitors drivers through their interactions with the steering wheel, turn signal, and speed setting, NHTSA said in a separate report. 
Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOG) Waymo unit, which is also working on self-driving technology, is taking a different approach, arguing that asking drivers to pay attention while the car drives itself is wrong. Waymo is focusing its efforts on fully autonomous vehicles where humans take no part in driving, rather driver assistance. ""We're not seeking to build a better car. Our goal is to build a better driver,"" Waymo Chief Executive Officer John Krafcik said earlier this year.",0.9369

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/how-ai-is-transforming-inventory-strategies-for-major-retailers-3247295,"Nov 30, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - In the dynamic retail landscape, major players like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Walgreens (WBA), and ASOS (LON:ASOS) are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to refine their inventory management strategies. This shift comes as a response to the challenges faced during the pandemic, where traditional forecasting models based on historical sales data proved inadequate amidst erratic consumer buying patterns. Retailers are now integrating more complex data sets, including social media trends and weather patterns, into their AI-driven forecasting tools to better anticipate and meet consumer demand.
Walmart, for instance, has enhanced its inventory management system to include data from weather forecasts and online searches, both on its platform and on search engines like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG). This approach allows the company to efficiently allocate products like toys and seasonal items to locations where they are most likely to be in demand. Similarly, Walgreens is utilizing AI to analyze data from social media and health trend reports, aiding in stocking their stores with the right health products during specific seasons.
The integration of AI in inventory management is not just about predicting consumer demand but also about optimizing the placement of inventory. With the rise of online shopping, retailers are tasked with keeping goods moving rapidly and efficiently to meet consumer expectations for quick fulfillment. Advanced AI and machine learning technologies are now capable of considering a wide array of influential factors, from viral social media content to local weather conditions, enabling more precise and effective inventory distribution.
This technological evolution in inventory management is crucial for retailers aiming to balance supply and demand, particularly after the pandemic-induced upheaval. The implementation of AI-driven systems is expected to lead to significant cost savings and improved customer satisfaction by ensuring the availability of desired products. As this trend continues, it's clear that AI will play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the future of retail supply chain management.

Microsoft and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have faced mounting scrutiny around the world over their dominance of the cloud computing industry, with regulators in Britain, the European Union, and the U.S. probing their market power. The CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) launched an investigation into Britain’s cloud computing industry in October, following a referral from media regulator Ofcom which highlighted Amazon and Microsoft’s dominance of the market. In 2022, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's Azure had a combined 70-80% share of Britain's public cloud infrastructure services market, Ofcom said. Google’s cloud division was their closest competitor, at around 5-10%. In a letter submitted to the CMA, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said Microsoft’s licensing practices unfairly discouraged customers from using competitor services, even as a secondary provider alongside Azure. “With Microsoft’s licensing restrictions in particular, UK customers are left with no economically reasonable alternative but to use Azure as their cloud services provider, even if they prefer the prices, quality, security, innovations, and features of rivals,” Google said in its letter to the CMA. Such practices directly harmed customers, and were the only significant barrier to competition in Britain’s cloud computing market, the company said. The CMA declined to comment. TACKLING CONCERNS  Microsoft last year updated its licensing rules to address such concerns and promote competition, though the changes did not satisfy rivals.  A Microsoft spokesperson said the company had worked with independent cloud providers to address concerns and provide opportunity and that more than 100 worldwide had taken advantage of the changes. ""As the latest independent data shows, competition between cloud hyperscalers remains healthy. In the second quarter of 2023 Microsoft and Google made equally small gains on AWS, which continues to remain the global market leader by a significant margin,"" the Microsoft spokesperson said. Speaking to Reuters, Google Cloud Vice President Amit Zavery criticised Microsoft’s practices, and said his company was committed to a multi-cloud approach, in which customers could easily move between providers depending on their needs. ""A lot of our software and cloud services interoperate, and can run on AWS or on Azure as well, so you're not restricted,"" he said. ""If you don't fix this, eventually you will have fewer cloud providers, and then innovation will not really happen, and investments will start shrinking."" At issue was Microsoft's decision to update the terms for when customers wanted to use their Windows or other software licenses in the cloud, effectively resulting in higher costs if they used Google or AWS instead of Microsoft's Azure. Asked why Amazon, which boasts a larger share of the cloud market than Microsoft, did not pose a similarly anticompetitive risk, Zavery said AWS consumers were not facing the same restrictions. “There are some issues, in terms of cloud interoperability, but we can fix that. That's a discussion between providers, which is much understood, and customers are forcing that conversation,” he said. 
“The problem we run into with Microsoft is that there's no technical issue, but you have licensing restrictions which means we are now being prevented from competing.”   Google made six recommendations to the CMA, including forcing Microsoft to improve interoperability for customers using Azure and alongside other cloud services, and banning it from withholding security updates from those that switch.",0.9822

""The option for people to purchase a subscription for no ads balances the requirements of European regulators while giving users choice and allowing Meta to continue serving all people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland,"" the company wrote.

BEUC said it was likely that users' data would continue to be collected and used for other purposes even if they select the new service.

""At this price, consumers are simply going to consent to Meta's profiling and tracking, which is exactly what the tech giant wants. People should not be asked to pay for protecting their privacy,"" Pachl said.

This sentiment arises from concerns over the sustainability of recent gains, particularly those driven by a small group of technology giants. David Noonan, a seasoned trader, exemplifies this cautious approach, having shifted to cash and short positions in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). This trend reflects a broader skepticism among investors about the market's reliance on key tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), collectively known as the 'magnificent seven.'
Recent market data underscores this cautious approach, with individual investors selling nearly $16 billion in stocks in October, marking the highest sell-off in two years. Even exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focusing on the tech sector, such as ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ), have experienced significant outflows. While some investors, like Gerardo Giusti, still view tech giants as viable long-term investments, their short-term prospects appear less certain. Giusti's current strategy includes diversifying into gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)), crypto (COIN), and cyclical sectors, while closely monitoring the Fed's interest rate decisions.
As the Fed signals a cautious approach to future rate hikes, optimism for rate cuts in 2024 has fueled recent stock surges. However, the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 presidential election and potential economic slowdown keeps traders like Giusti on alert for market shifts. On the other hand, Ashton Jones, a financial analyst and part-time trader, anticipates a year-end rally but is preparing for a pullback in January. His plan to short the market reflects a common sentiment among traders: while the market's current trajectory defies gravity, a correction seems inevitable, driven by profit-taking and seasonal patterns.
In summary, the current market scenario presents a complex picture for retail traders. While the stock rally has been strong, the heavy dependence on a few tech giants combined with potential economic headwinds and political uncertainties has prompted many to secure their gains and adopt a more defensive stance.

https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/cryptocrunch-bitcoin-ripple-ethereum-tumble-as-selling-intensifies-1342328,"Mar 14, 2018","Investing.com – Bitcoin fell sharply amid broad-based cryptocurrency selling as negative sentiment deepened after Google said it would ban all crypto-related advertisement. 
The move comes amid mounting fears of a coordinate effort by international regulators in Europe, U.S., Asia to curb cryptocurrency activity. 
Japan is expected to urge its G20 counterparts at a meeting next week to step up efforts to prevent cryptocurrencies from being used for money laundering, Reuters reported citing a government official with direct knowledge of the matter.
IMF chief Christine Lagarde said this week that the same technology that powered cryptocurrencies could be used to help regulate them. “We can harness the potential of crypto-assets while ensuring that they never become a haven for illegal activity or a source of financial vulnerability.”
On the bitfinex exchange, Bitcoin fell 11.63% to $8,050. The popular currency has struggled to find its footing after attempts to rally above $11,000 to $12,000 zone was met with selling resistance. 
The dour mood in cryptomarkets was characterised by a slump in the total cryptomarket cap to about $330 billion – at the time of writing – down from $364 billion Tuesday, reaching levels last seen when bitcoin fell to $6,000.
Ripple XRP fell 10.93% to $0.68139 on the poloniex exchange, while Ethereum fell 11.93% to $682.99.",-0.8176
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-sonos-soars-analyst-says-it-hits-all-the-apple-notes-2013676,"Nov 06, 2019","Investing.com – Sonos surged on Wednesday as one Wall Street analyst said the audio company could be next on the shopping list for big tech firms, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) touted as a potential suitor.
With its push into connected home efforts, which needs improvement, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would ""materially"" benefit from making a play for Sonos, said D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Forte. Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) rose 5%.
The spotlight on smaller hardware makers rose to the fore less than a week ago, when Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) bought wearables company Fitbit in a $2.1 billion deal. Apple was also rumored to be circling but was not prepared to cut as big a check as Google did for the wearables company.
Sonos, however, hits all the right notes for Apple to take notice, boasting many similarities such as high product quality and design acumen. Sonos can also charge a premium given its superior brand status, according to Forte.
""Just as Fitbit fills a void for Google when it comes to healthcare-related data, acquiring Sonos could materially advance Apple's connected home efforts (an area we believe it needs improvement and where its own product, the HomePod, was a disappointment),"" he added.
But there could be one hitch to a potential Apple-Sonos deal – regulation.
The regulatory powers have grown wary of big tech's growing influence and may not be eager to rubber-stamp a deal, Forte suggested.

Twitter shares rose as much as 4.8 percent after the messaging service announced its latest upper-management shake-up. The previous CFO, Mike Gupta, was named senior vice president of strategic investments on Tuesday.  Twitter has reported lackluster user and usage growth for the last couple of quarters and its stock price has nearly halved in the last six months.  Last month, Twitter Chief Operating Officer Ali Rowghani departed after clashing with Chief Executive Dick Costolo over whether he should continue to oversee product innovation, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Chloe Sladden, vice president of media, also departed recently.  With Noto in the CFO seat, Twitter hopes to better explain its business opportunities to Wall Street, a person familiar with the matter said.  ""Anthony has got a pretty good finger on the pulse of the Street,"" the person said.  A former Army ranger and National Football League executive, Noto, 46, started as an analyst at Goldman and later became a managing director in the investment firm's technology, media and telecom investment banking group.  Noto, who was among a number of analysts who touted stocks like Webvan and eToys that collapsed during the 2000 dotcom bust, won plaudits for netting Twitter's coveted IPO in 2013 and handling its smooth market debut. He was crowned the top-rated Internet analyst for five years in a row by Institutional Investor magazine in the mid-2000s.  Noto's move to Twitter comes roughly six weeks after reports that he was leaving Goldman Sachs to join hedge fund Coatue Management. Instead, Noto began working at Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on Tuesday.  Hudson Square analyst Daniel Ernst said Noto's experience as CFO at the NFL should help Twitter gain more ground in television and advertising.  ""He just brings a different skill set. A set that really has very high level view of the competitive landscape, he understands very well what the investment community is looking for given his previous role,"" Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter said.  Gupta, who joined Twitter in 2012 from social gaming company Zynga Inc (O:ZNGA), will oversee a new effort to invest in start-up companies, similar to Google Inc's (O:GOOGL) (O:GOOG) in-house venture capital arm Google Ventures.  Noto will receive an annual salary of $250,000 and one-time restricted stock options of 1.5 million shares, Twitter said in a filing. As of Monday's close, those options were valued at $61.5 million.  
Twitter went public in November at $26 a share. The stock rose to a high of $74.73 in December.  Shares rose as high as $42.95 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday before ending $1.08 stronger at $42.05.

"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive:-microsoft's-digital-assistant-to-head-to-android,-apple-devices-332232","Mar 13, 2015","By Bill Rigby SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is working on an advanced version of its competitor to Apple's Siri, using research from an artificial intelligence project called ""Einstein.""     Microsoft has been running its ""personal assistant"" Cortana on its Windows phones for a year, and will put the new version on the desktop with the arrival of Windows 10 this autumn. Later, Cortana will be available as a standalone app, usable on phones and tablets powered by Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iOS and  Google Inc  (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s (O:GOOG) Android, people familiar with the project said.     ""This kind of technology, which can read and understand email, will play a central role in the next roll out of Cortana, which we are working on now for the fall time frame,"" said Eric Horvitz, managing director of Microsoft Research and a part of the Einstein project, in an interview at the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters.       The plan to put Cortana on machines running software from rivals such as Apple and Google, as well as the Einstein project, have not been reported. Cortana is the name of an artificial intelligence character in the video game series ""Halo.""     They represent a new front in CEO Satya Nadella's battle to sell Microsoft software on any device or platform, rather than trying to force customers to use Windows. Success on rivals' platforms could create new markets and greater relevance for the company best known for its decades-old operating system.     The concept of 'artificial intelligence' is broad, and mobile phones and computers already show dexterity with spoken language and sifting through emails for data, for instance.     Still, Microsoft believes its work on speech recognition, search and machine learning will let it transform its digital assistant into the first intelligent 'agent' which anticipates users needs. By comparison, Siri is advertised mostly as responding to requests. Google's mobile app, which doesn't have a name like Siri or Cortana, already offers some limited predictive information 'cards' based on what it thinks the user wants to know.     Microsoft has tried to create digital assistants before, without success. Microsoft Bob, released in 1995, was supposed to make using a computer easy, but ended up being the butt of jokes. The Office Assistant nicknamed 'Clippy' suffered a similar fate a few years later.     ""We're defining the competitive landscape... of who can provide the most supportive services that make life easier, keep track of things, that complement human memory in a way that helps us get things done,"" said Horvitz.      Outside his door stands ""The Assistant"", a monitor showing a woman's face that can converse with visitors, has access to Horvitz's calendar and can book meetings.      On his desktop, Horvitz runs 'Lifebrowser', a program that stores everything from appointments to photos and uses machine learning to identify the important moments. A keyword search for his university professor instantly brings up photos and video from the last time they met.     Cortana could tell a mobile phone user when to leave for the airport, days after it read an email and realized the user was planning a flight. It would automatically check flight status, determine where the phone is located using GPS, and checking traffic conditions.     None of the individual steps are a breakthrough, but creating an artificial intelligence that can stitch together the processes marks a breakthrough in usefulness, Microsoft says.     Rivals are on the same track. Google's latest mobile app uses the predictive power generated from billions of searches to work out what a user is doing, what they are interested in, and sending relevant information, such as when a favorite sports team is playing next.     Apple is also pushing Siri, which uses Microsoft's Bing search engine in the background, into new areas with its CarPlay and HomeKit platforms, as well as the recently unveiled Apple Watch.      The key to Cortana's success will be knowing where a user is, what time it is, and what they are trying to do. Albert Einstein's work on the relationship between space and time gave rise to Microsoft's secret project name, said Horvitz.     ""Einstein was brilliant about space and time,"" he said. ""It's using brilliance about space and time generally in our agents.""",0.9946

The California Department of Motor Vehicles said on Wednesday it revoked the registration of 16 Uber self-driving cars because they had not been properly permitted. For the last week, the agency was demanding that Uber shut down its program and comply with regulations requiring a permit to test self-driving cars on public roads. Uber said it was not obligated to have a permit because its vehicles require continuous monitoring by a person in the car. San Francisco was supposed to be Uber's second testing ground for its self-driving cars. The company unveiled its self-driving cars in September in Pittsburgh.  ""We're now looking at where we can redeploy these cars but remain 100 percent committed to California and will be redoubling our efforts to develop workable statewide rules,"" an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement. California defines autonomous vehicles as having the capability to drive ""without the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person."" Uber has argued that the law does not apply to its cars, which cannot stay in autonomous mode continuously. A driver and an engineer are in the front seats to take over frequently in sticky traffic situations such as construction zones or pedestrian crossings.  Uber's defiance was met with threats of legal action from the DMV and the state attorney general. The DMV told Uber that if it had obtained a permit, the regulator would have given the green light to the self-driving pilot. DMV director Jean Shiomoto said in a letter sent to Uber on Wednesday that she would ""personally help to ensure an expedited review and approval process,"" which she said can take less than three days. The permit process is largely seen as a public safety measure, as regulations also require that companies provide the DMV with accident reports. Uber, however, has complained that its home state has favored complex rules over technological innovation. It is not yet clear whether Uber will apply for the permit or simply bring the self-driving cars to another state.  Another 20 companies exploring self-driving cars, including Alphabet's (O:GOOG) Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL),  Tesla Motors  (O:TSLA) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), have obtained California DMV permits for 130 cars.

https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/uber-takes-action-to-fix-unsafe-cars-rented-to-singapore-drivers-514571,"Aug 04, 2017","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] knowingly rented its drivers defective cars at risk of catching fire, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, and the ride-hailing firm said it moved to fix the problem after one of the vehicles suffered a blaze. The Journal cited internal emails and documents showing Uber's Singapore unit bought more than 1,000 Vezel sport-utility vehicles that maker Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) had recalled due to an electrical fault. It reported the Singapore management was aware of the recall, and that the cars Uber had bought and rented out had not been repaired. The Journal also said management pressed the car dealer for repairs whilst renting out the vehicles.  ""As soon as we learned of a Honda Vezel from the Lion City Rental fleet catching fire, we took swift action to fix the problem, in close coordination with Singapore's Land Transport Authority,"" Uber said in a statement. The Journal reported the vehicle caught fire in January. A spokesperson for Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) said in a statement that it had been ""closely monitoring the recall and rectification progress for affected Honda Vezels"".  The LTA spokesperson said its records, based on latest information provided by importers and dealers, showed that among the Honda Vezels owned by Lion City Rental Pte Ltd (LCR), 9 percent had been rectified. ""LTA is working with LCR and importers to update this figure and ensure all vehicles are rectified,"" the LTA spokesperson said.  An Uber spokesman in Singapore declined to elaborate on whether management knowingly rented out defective vehicles, directing Reuters to the company statement. The spokesman said all vehicles had now been repaired. ""We acknowledge we could have done more - and we have done so,"" Uber said in its statement. It said it had hired three experts ""whose sole job is to ensure we are fully responsive to safety recalls."" The Journal reported that Uber's lawyers had assessed potential legal liabilities including possibly violating driver contracts. ""There is clearly a large safety/responsible actor/brand integrity/PR issue,"" for Uber, an internal report read, according to the Journal. Uber, which has pulled out of massive markets China and Russia, used Singapore as a springboard to grow in populous Southeast Asia. The region is dominated by Grab, which says it has a 95 percent market share in third-party taxi-hailing and 71 percent in private vehicle hailing. The local incumbent said last month said had raised $2.5 billion to fund further growth. Grab said on Friday its drivers do not use the Vezel model that was subject to recall. ""(This incident) will receive some attention and may dissuade some people from using Uber, but I don't see it as having a major impact,"" said Dane Anderson, a vice president at researcher Forrester. ""The government is very pragmatic and has been friendly to services like this and to business in general. I think it will continue to do what it has always done, which is continue to take a balanced, measured, pragmatic view,"" Anderson said. The Journal report is the latest blow to Uber in Asia. Authorities in places such as Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have questioned the legality of its apps, which connect private car owners with fare-paying passengers, pitting them against licensed taxi drivers. The firm has had to suspend operations on several occasions, as in Macau last month.  
At home, Uber is the subject of a federal inquiry into software that helped drivers avoid authorities in areas within which it did not have official permission to operate. It is also involved in an intellectual property lawsuit filed by the self-driving car unit of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOG).",0.1601

In an announcement coinciding with the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Ford said it will begin using a new, lower cost LiDAR sensor made by California-based Velodyne. The high cost of such sensors, which act as the eyes of a self-driving car, is one of the main technical obstacles to widespread commercialization of self-driving vehicles, industry executives say.  Ford said it will be the first automaker to use Velodyne's new solid state ""hybrid Ultra PUCK Auto"" sensor. The compact device replaces the spinning scanners mounted on the rooftops of some autonomous test vehicles. Ford said two of these sensors could replace four current LiDAR sensors. The Ultra PUCKs are small enough to mount on a side-view mirror, Ford said. Ford said it will add 20 hybrid Ford Fusion sedans to its existing 10-vehicle self-driving car fleet, and test them on roads in California, Arizona and Michigan. Rival automakers are also testing fleets of self-driving cars on and off public roads. Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOG) Google (O:GOOGL) has been testing self-driving cars of various kinds, including some of its own design, since 2009. Separately, Ford said it is exploring ways to link in-home automation devices such as Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Echo to the Sync communications systems in its cars to allow consumers to control lights or thermostats inside the home from the car, or start up cars and check fuel levels from inside the house. 
In a third technology-related move, Ford said it will collaborate with drone maker DJI to sponsor a contest to develop drone-to-vehicle communications systems using the connectivity systems on a Ford F-150.

https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-challenges-10000-level-amid-extended-sell-off-1912573,"Jul 01, 2019","Investing.com - Bitcoin on Monday extended its retreat from last week, though it held above the key $10,000 level.
Bitcoin fell 10.65% to $10,258. It's now off about 26% from its June 26 interim high of $13,929.80.
A decline of 20% or more from a recent high is the popular definition of a bear market.
In a sign of hope for bitcoin bulls, the plunge to the $10,000 level offered support, with some predicting limited downside activity in the popular crypto as its diversification benefits represent a compelling opportunity for institutional investors.
“Bitcoin's most compelling case for institutional investors may be as an uncorrelated asset to stocks, bonds, gold and oil, as bitcoin continues to demonstrate low correlation to other asset classes,” Canaccord said in its Bitcoin Monthly report.
The move lower in bitcoin, however, is unsurprising as traders likely continue to lock in profits after the popular cryptocurrencies soared through multiple key psychological levels, boasting gains of 26% in June.
The popular crypto has nearly trebled since the turn of the year, a move – unlike the 2017 rally - that was likely led by institutional investors rather than retail.
“While the parabolic move in 2017 was likely led by retail investors (over 100K new Coinbase accounts being set up per day), Google Trends data shows that search interest for bitcoin is not even close to previous levels,” Canaccord added.
“Instead, open interest in CME bitcoin futures reached all-time highs last week, indicating that the fuel behind this rally could be new capital flowing in from institutional investors.”
For the moment, however, bitcoin would likely have to stabilize outflows to stop the current malaise.
Bitcoin’s market cap, often used as a gauge of demand, fell 25% to $183 billion over the past week.
Other cryptos also trended lower, with XRP falling 2.68% to $0.39527, Ethereum down 5.87% to $285.13 and Litecoin plunigng 11.37% to $117.03.",0.9814

On the bitfinex exchange, Bitcoin rose 1.61% to $8,218. The popular currency has struggled to find its footing after attempts to rally above $11,000 to $12,000 zone was met with staunch resistance.
Yet, the rebound in bitcoin likely reflects easing selling pressure - as traders take some of their profit off the table given the nearly 7% this week - rather than increasing buying pressure as demand for cryptos remained subdued.
The total cryptomarket cap at $329 billion – at the time of writing – is down nearly $50 billion from roughly $376 billion last week, at a time when an increase in buying activity is needed to avert a retest of bitcoin's $6,000 low seen February 6.
Frank Cappelleri, executive director, institutional equities at Nomura Instinet, warned recently that “if bitcoin fails to garner demand at current levels then “the February lows [around $6,000] would in the cross-hairs.""
Sentiment on bitcoin has rapidly turned negative as regulators and large tech companies stepped up efforts to curb crypto-related activity.
Google said on Wednesday said it would ban all crypto-related advertisement, furthering limit the exposure of cryptocurrencies after Facebook adopted a similar measure in January. On the regulatory front, the SEC said recently it was taking a closer to look at crypto-trading platforms offering “exchange-like services,” which it said could be violating the law.
International regulators, meanwhile, have continued to voice their concerns about the dangers of an unregulated cryptomarket, stoking fears that a further regulatory crackdown beckons for the industry sooner rather than later.

Reports emerged on Sunday that Twitter is planning to update its advertising policy so that all the ads relating to ICOs, token sales and cryptocurrency wallets would no longer be allowed. The new policy could become effective in two weeks.
Separately, traders investing in Bitcoin could subject to heavy tax bills, according to the Guardians, which reported that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) warned ""anything purchased using a digital currency is liable to be taxed as a capital gain."" The news came after the IRS learned that only about 800 taxpayers claimed bitcoin gains in each year during 2013 to 2015.

The earnings season kicks up a gear Thursday, with quarterly earnings from tech heavyweights. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report after markets close.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to report earnings per share of 89 cents for the second quarter on sales of $15.7 billion.
The chipmaker’s data center business, which represents almost a third of total revenue, will likely garner added attention as data center spending has been hurt by a slowdown in China.
With shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) up more than 30% year to date and flirting with $1 trillion in market cap, it may take a lot to impress investors tomorrow.
Performance of the company’s North America segment, which accounts for the bulk of revenue, and its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, will be closely watched.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to report earnings of $5.56 a share on revenue of about $62.5 billion, according to estimates compiled by Investing.com.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is expected to report earnings of $11.10 a share on revenue of $38.2 billion.
Margins likely will be closely watched as the search-engine giant has increased focus on lower-margin businesses like Cloud, YouTube and hardware. The company in the first quarter said that it would ramp up spending on marketing. 
3. Jobless Claims, Durable Goods on Tap
Durable goods orders and jobless claims numbers make up the top-tier economic data on the calendar Thursday.
The Commerce Department will report June’s orders for goods lasting three years or more at 8:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Durable goods orders are expected to rebound 0.8% in June following a 1.3% decline in May, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are predicted to have risen 0.2% in June compared with 0.4% in the prior month.
Also at 8:30 AM ET, the Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended July 20. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims increased to 220,000 from 216,000 previously.",0.9823
https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-recovery-falters-after-rise-near-hurdle-1479543,"Jun 04, 2018","Investing.com – Bitcoin's move higher Monday was met with stern resistance, turning the popular crypto negative amid a lack of positive catalysts to reignite meaningful demand.
Bitcoin fell 2.84% to $7,503.6 on the Bitfinex exchange after testing a session high of $7,764.
Bitcoin's move higher to near $7,800 triggered resistance as it was a price level identified last week as the ""next hurdle"" in the popular crypto's recovery after it rebounded from a tumble close to $7,500.
Robert Sluymer, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors Sluymer said last week bitcoin would have to sustain a rally above its next “hurdle” around the $7,800 price level, to validate the next phase of its recovery.
The waning demand for the popular crypto was characterised by its dwindling popularity on the internet as searches for the term ""bitcoin"" have dropped more than 75% since the beginning of this year, according to research from Google Trends. This was cited as a bad omen for bitcoin enthusiasts as the volume of searches for ""bitcoin,"" is often viewed as a ""proxy for potential new buyers,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.
Colas added that he ""was not a fan of buying bitcoin at current [price] levels"".
The total market cap of cryptocurrencies totalled about $337 billion, at the time of writing, to remain above last week's $329 billion.
Ripple XRP fell 2.25% to $0.64805 on the Poloniex exchange, while Ethereum fell 4.37% to $591.02.
Bitcoin Cash fell 6.53% to $1,093.50, while Litecoin fell 4.54% to $119.24.",0.8333
https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-continues-to-slide-as-critics-turn-up-the-volume-1436069,"May 08, 2018","Investing.com - Cryptocurrencies continued to slide on Tuesday as a wave of high profile criticism seemed to dampen sentiment for the digital asset.
Bitcoin lost 2.73% in the last 24 hours to reach $9,109.10 on the Bitfinex exchange by 8:38AM ET (12:38GMT). The largest crypto by market capitalization has been trading with losses all week after an attack at the $10,000 level last Saturday petered out at $9,990.
The downward move this week coincided with a harsh critique from billionaire investor Warren Buffett who denied Bitcoin was an investment, insisting it was pure speculation.
Buffett, who has long railed against the digital coin assets, followed up the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) annual meeting over the weekend with an interview with CNBC.
“When you're buying nonproductive assets, all you're counting on is the next person is going to pay you more because they're even more excited about another next person coming along,” he insisted.
He followed up Monday in the CNBC interview, claiming that Bitcoin was “probably rat poison squared”.
Bill Gates echoed that sentiment in the CNBC interview, calling it a “pure ‘greater fool theory’ type of investment”.
“I would short it if there was an easy way to do it,” Gates added.
DataTrek Research cofounder Nick Colas added more fuel to fire late Monday as he advised against investing in Bitcoin.
Colas, considered to be the first Wall Street analyst to cover the asset, told CNBC that he was getting a lot of questions from clients about how Bitcoin had crashed from nearly $20,000 and they were wondering if now was the time to buy.
“The short answer is no,” Colas claimed, citing lackluster fundamentals, a decline in interest (as shown by Google search trends and wallet growth) and wild price swings that he considers indicate anything but a healthy sign of a stable asset class.
In other Bitcoin news, the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank blamed the severe correction from all-time highs on the introduction of Bitcoin futures.
“The launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics,” the researchers said in a report.
“The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence,” they insisted. “Rather, it is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.”
In other cryptocurrency trading, Ethereum fell 0.5% to $727.45 in the last 24 hours, Ripple traded down 2.9% to $0.79834, while Bitcoin Cash, product of the Bitcoin fork and the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, slid 4.3% to $1,564.60.",-0.7215
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/google-deepminds-ai-predicts-structures-of-over-2-million-new-materials-3246210,"Nov 29, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - Google's (GOOGL) DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), has made a groundbreaking discovery in material science using artificial intelligence (AI). The firm's AI has predicted the structure of over two million potential new materials, with nearly 400,000 of these designs being viable for production in laboratory conditions. This advancement, published in the journal Nature, holds immense potential for enhancing technologies in various sectors, including the development of more efficient batteries, solar panels, and computer chips.
The process of discovering and synthesizing new materials traditionally involves extensive research and significant investment, often spanning decades, as seen with the development of lithium-ion batteries. DeepMind's research scientist Ekin Dogus Cubuk expressed optimism that advancements in experimentation, autonomous synthesis, and AI models could drastically reduce this lengthy timeline. DeepMind's AI, trained on data from the Materials Project—an international collaboration founded at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory—represents a leap forward in accelerating material discovery.
DeepMind plans to share its extensive data on these new materials with the broader research community, aiming to catalyze further advancements and practical applications. Kristin Persson, director of the Materials Project, highlighted the cautious approach of the industry towards new materials due to cost concerns. DeepMind's AI-driven discoveries could significantly shorten the time it takes for new materials to become cost-effective and commercially viable, marking a pivotal moment in material science.
Looking ahead, DeepMind's next objective is to use AI to predict the ease of synthesizing these materials in laboratory settings. This move could further streamline the development process, transforming the way new materials are discovered and brought to market. The implications of this research are vast, potentially leading to innovations that reshape industries and drive technological progress.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/largest-us-radio-company-iheartmedia-files-for-bankruptcy-1342686,"Mar 15, 2018","By Tom Hals (Reuters) - IHeartMedia Inc (PK:IHRT) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Thursday as the largest U.S. radio station owner reached an agreement with creditors to more than halve its $20 billion in debt. The company said the agreement it ‍reached with holders of more than $10 billion of its outstanding debt would restructure its balance sheet by transferring 94 percent of the stock in the reorganized company to its lenders.  IHeartMedia has struggled with debt that was taken on to finance a $17.9 billion leveraged buyout, or LBO, in 2008 of what was then Clear Channel Communications Inc. That deal led by Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP closed just as a financial crisis began to undermine the U.S. economy. In the years that followed, the operator of 849 radio stations has faced intensifying competition for advertisers and listeners from internet platforms such as music streaming services. ""The LBO put this massive debt on the balance sheet that the company was supposed to grow into,"" a lawyer for iHeartMedia told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Marvin Isgur at a hearing in Houston on Thursday. ""We’re here to right-size the balance sheet."" The company traces its roots to the 1972 purchase of KEEZ-FM in San Antonio, Texas, where it is currently headquartered. It said it would fund the business and bankruptcy process from cash on hand and cash generated from operations. It said in a statement it was seeking to maintain business as usual during the bankruptcy, and to ""uphold its commitments"" to its staff. It employs 12,400 people, according to court records. The filing comes less than four months after Cumulus Media Inc, which operates 445 U.S. radio stations, filed for Chapter 11. DEBT-CUTTING DEAL IHeartMedia had $3.58 billion in revenue in 2017 and reaches 271 million radio listeners, which the company says gives it a wider reach than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's (O:GOOG) Google. The company also sells advertising on digital platforms, at live concerts and on syndicated programs featuring personalities such as Rush Limbaugh and ""American Idol"" host Ryan Seacrest.  However, the company spent $1.4 billion on interest payments last year and has more than $8 billion in debt maturing by the end of 2019.  The company's lawyers told the court iHeartMedia was on the cusp of having enough support from creditors to impose its plan on hold-outs. Under the company's debt-cutting deal, holders of secured loans and secured notes, who are owed nearly $13 billion, agreed to accept about $5.6 billion in new debt and 94 percent of the equity in a reorganized iHeartMedia, according to court documents.  These creditors also will receive iHeartMedia's 89.5 percent stake in  Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc  (N:CCO), the world's largest billboard company, which did not file for bankruptcy. IHeartMedia also proposed that junior debt holders, who are owed more than $2 billion, will receive their pro rata share of 5 percent of the equity in the reorganized company and $200 million in new secured notes. Existing shareholders would receive 1 percent of the stock in the reorganized company, according to court documents. IHeartMedia faces a legal challenge from a group, led by investment fund Angelo, Gordon & Co, which holds $190 million of junior debt, according to the company.  Their lawyer said at Thursday's hearing they plan to file a lawsuit to challenge the contention that they are low-priority unsecured creditors, and Isgur said he wanted a hearing on that dispute before April. 
IHeartMedia has drawn interest from John Malone's Liberty Media Corp (O:FWONA), which proposed on Feb. 26 a deal to buy a 40 percent stake in a restructured iHeartMedia for $1.16 billion. The deal would unite iHeartMedia with Liberty's Sirius XM Holdings Inc (O:SIRI) satellite radio service.",0.9201

https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/russian-court-rules-to-block-access-to-telegram-messenger-tass-1393297,"Apr 13, 2018","By Jack Stubbs and Andrey Ostroukh MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court on Friday ordered that access to the Telegram messenger service be blocked in Russia, heralding possible communication disruption for millions of users in the latest clash between global technology firms and Russian authorities. The decision came a week after state communication watchdog, Roskomnadzor, filed a lawsuit to limit access to Telegram following the company's repeated refusal to give Russian state security services access to its users' secret messages. As part of its services, Telegram allows its more than 200 million global users, including senior Russian government officials, to communicate via encrypted messages which cannot be read by third parties. But Russia's FSB Federal Security service has said it needs access to some of those messages for its work that includes guarding against terrorist attacks. Telegram has refused to comply with the demands, citing respect for user privacy. ""The court decided to meet the requirements of Roskomnadzor, impose restrictions on access to Telegram messenger and stop providing technical conditions for the exchange of messages,"" the TASS news agency quoted judge Yulia Smolina as saying. Roskomnadzor head Alexander Zharov said the ban would be enforced soon but would not say exactly when, TASS reported. Roskomnadzor later added Telegram to its register of banned websites, paving the way for it to be blocked.  Russia's top network providers, Megafon and MTS, declined to comment on the ban. Competitor Beeline said it would ""act within the framework of the law."" Telegram founder and CEO, Pavel Durov, said the app will use built-in systems to circumnavigate the ban but could not guarantee 100 percent access without the use of a virtual private network, or VPN. Pavel Chikov, a lawyer representing Telegram, said the court decision was warning to global technology firms of the dangers of operating in Russia. ""They have demonstrated again and again that the court system is devoted to serving the interests of the authorities. They no longer even care about basic external appearances,"" he said on his Telegram channel.  Fallout from the court decision will also be closely watched by investors as Telegram is undertaking the world's biggest initial coin offering - a private sale of tokens which can be traded as an alternative currency, similar to Bitcoin or Ethereum. The company has so far raised $1.7 billion in pre-sales via the offering, according to media reports.  KREMLIN USERS  Ranked as the world's ninth most popular mobile messaging app, Telegram is widely used in countries across the former Soviet Union and Middle East. As well as being popular with journalists and members of Russia's political opposition, Telegram is also used by the Kremlin to communicate with reporters and arrange regular conference calls with President Vladimir Putin's spokesman. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Friday, organized using Telegram, that his office would soon move to another messaging service. ""Limiting access was not the goal in and of itself,"" he said. ""There is the legal position, which requires the provision of data to certain Russian state bodies. Meetings this condition would have allowed for a consensus. But unfortunately this consensus was not reached."" Telegram is the second global network to be blocked in Russia after LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) was banned in 2016 for failing to comply with a law that requires companies holding Russian citizens' data to store it on servers on Russian soil.  Other international technology companies, such as Facebook (O:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google (L:GOOG), have also clashed recently with Russian regulators.  Roskomnadzor asked Facebook earlier this week about the steps it was taking to meet its requirements under the data law and has said it will carry out an audit of Facebook's compliance with Russian legislation in the second half of 2018. Durov himself left Russia in 2014 after selling the country's biggest social media network, VK, to a businessman close to the Kremlin after coming under pressure from Russian authorities.  Russian users will still be able to access Telegram's services by using VPNs, which allow people to bypass internet restrictions imposed by authorities. When Reuters asked a person in the Russian government how they would operate without access to Telegram, the person, who asked not be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue, replied by sending a screenshot of his mobile phone with an open VPN app. Russia's deputy communications minister, Alexei Volin, said VPNs and other ways of circumnavigating the ban meant Telegram users would not be greatly inconvenienced. 
""Many Telegram users have already adopted different messengers, and those who want to stay with this product know a lot of ways to get round the ban and continue using the services they are used to,"" Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.",-0.9932

The deal, flagged Tuesday by Google executive Greg DeMichillie in a briefing and expected to be announced formally on Wednesday, highlights the momentum Google Cloud Platform has gained under the leadership of Diane Greene, a co-founder of VMWare who joined Google late last year. VMWare sells its ""virtualization"" technology for improving the efficiency of data centers to many of the same customers that Google Cloud is targeting. Many of Google Cloud’s more prominent customers, including message service Snapchat, are new Internet-based companies - not always the best references for chief information officers at more traditional companies. Landing Home Depot, the Atlanta-based construction and home-improvement retailer with over 2,000 stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, bolsters Google Cloud’s standing among bricks and mortar businesses. Home Depot declined to provide any details on its deal with Google. Google’s cloud business generated about $500 million in revenues last year, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). That compares to $74.5 billion overall for parent company Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), but the cloud business is one of its fastest-growing business areas. Overall, Google is the No.4 player in cloud infrastructure services, according to Synergy Research, with 4 percent market share last year. Amazon's AWS took 31 percent of the market, Microsoft's Azure 9 percent, and  IBM  (N:IBM), 7 percent.  But there are signs Google is gaining ground. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), long a user of Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure, has started using Google’s cloud for its iCloud, the service that allows Apple customers to store music, photos, and documents, according to an industry executive. And last month, music service Spotify, a high-profile customer of Amazon’s AWS, said it would use Google’s cloud for some computing infrastructure. Google is also building up its data centers across the world, launching two new regional centers in Japan and Oregon to bring the number of regions it serves to five. Google kicks off its cloud conference in San Francisco Wednesday with a keynote speech by Greene, who is expected to outline her cloud strategy in her first major appearance since joining the company.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/european-regulators-training-sights-on-google's-mobile-software-299300,"Jul 30, 2014","By Foo Yun Chee and Alexei Oreskovic BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - European regulators are preparing what could be a stern challenge to Google Inc's (O:GOOGL) (O:GOOG) mobile software business in the coming months after a nearly four-year investigation into the company's Web search practices left rivals and European politicians dissatisfied.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said that with a new antitrust chief taking over in November, European regulators are laying the groundwork for a case centered on whether Google abuses the 80 percent market share of its Android mobile operating system to promote services from maps to search.
The Commission has stepped up inquiries just in recent weeks, sending companies questionnaires that seek far more details than previous queries on the matter in 2011 and 2013.
In one questionnaire seen by Reuters, respondents were asked whether there was a requirement set by Google, written or unwritten, that they not pre-install apps, products or services on mobile devices that compete with Google software like its search engine, app store and maps.
Companies must provide emails, faxes, letters, notes from phone calls and meetings, and presentations stretching as far back as 2007 related to such deals with Google, suggesting the European Commission wants to know if Google's behavior has been long-term. Respondents have been given until early September to reply to more than 40 questions.
While any company is free to use the open-source Android as they choose, mobile handset makers that want to use the newest version must sign a contract that stipulates a minimum number of Google services be pre-installed on devices, according to a third source, a former Google executive with knowledge of the matter.
The impending Android inquiry adds to a growing list of regulatory challenges that complicate the Internet company's ambitions in a vital market. Europe accounted for more than $30 billion in digital advertising spending in 2013.
The European Commission is likely to start a formal probe into Android once it wraps up an investigation into whether Google ranks its own services higher than those of its rivals in search results, according to the two people with knowledge of the matter.
One of the sources said going after Android would help stem a growing chorus of complaints.
Google struck a deal with Almunia in February by agreeing to display rivals' links more prominently, but the preliminary settlement was criticized as inadequate by rivals such as Microsoft Corp, U.S. consumer review site Yelp Inc and German and Spanish publishers, as well as some European politicians.
Outgoing European Commission antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia may decide to open a second case against Google at the same time he announces the closing of the first, the source said.
""It's a political game. Can Almunia afford not to bring a case? He has to bring a case,"" the source said.
WAVE OF DISTRUST
Google faces criticism in Europe about everything from privacy to tax policies, and is wrestling with a European court's ruling that requires it to remove links from search results that individuals find objectionable. For a Factbox, please click
Android's 80 percent market share is at a level akin to Microsoft's Windows, itself the target of a long-running European investigation.
At the same time, the company has grown so large as to inspire distrust in some corners, with a chorus of public criticism from politicians and business executives. Mathias Dopfner, the Chief Executive of German publisher Axel Springer said he was ""afraid"" of Google in an April open letter published in German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Axel Springer is a member of the Open Internet Project, which has submitted a complaint against Google to the EC.
""They are in a stormy patch at the moment"" in Europe, says Alasdair Young, a professor at Georgia Tech's Sam Nunn School of International Affairs. ""It's pretty unusual for a company to be hit by so many big policy threats at the same time.""
The search investigation is not a done deal, with the Commission having indicated it may seek more concessions from Google before making a final decision in September.
But the real fight may be shifting to mobile.
Search is ""like the movie everybody's already walked out of,"" said David Balto, a former Policy Director at the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, who has done some consulting work for Google. ""People are going in there, trying to collect the popcorn boxes, but they don't notice the movie's over.""
Android represents a crucial channel for Google to extend its search engine into the mobile world. Regulatory action that impedes Google's ability put search front-and-center within Android could threaten its primary money-making service.
Handset makers such as Samsung (KS:005930) and LG Electronics (KS:066570) may also benefit by being freer to pre-install or alternative online services on devices. That may in turn grant better shop-window placement to rival services from Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Yahoo (O:YHOO).
A Google spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that Google is committed to keeping Android open and that ""anyone can use Android without Google, and anyone can use Google without Android.""
""Since Android's introduction, greater competition in the smartphone market has given consumers more and better choices. Both the U.S. FTC and Korean Fair Trade Commission have examined Google's agreements around Android in depth and concluded that there was no cause for legal concern,"" the spokeswoman said.
LONG ARM OF THE LAW
But the questionnaires sent to telecoms operators and handset makers using Android suggest that the European regulators are looking for evidence to build its case.
Regulators asked if Google had ever communicated ""that it was not in favor of your undertaking manufacturing, marketing or launching a smart mobile device with your own or a third-party application or service pre-installed or set as default.""
Another question asked for examples of major commercial difficulties faced by app stores competing with Google Play. The watchdog also asked for details of revenue-sharing with Google.
Much will depend on Almunia's successor. The 66-year-old Spaniard, whose term as antitrust chief ends in October, has fueled a growing feeling within the Commission that he may have been too soft on Google. The incoming head may decide to take a tougher line following criticism in recent months from French and German ministers as well as European lawmakers.
Mindful of the Commission's power to impose multi-billion euro fines and the distraction of a drawn-out regulatory battle that could hurt the corporate image, Google will likely seek a quick end to any Android probe, said Andreas Kafetzopoulos, a lawyer at Dechert, whose practice focuses on European competition law.

""In fast-moving technology markets, protracted adversarial antitrust proceedings rarely benefit anyone. Settlement would again be the most likely outcome of a new Google case,"" Kafetzopoulos said.

Six days of public hearings on the proposed duties of up to 25 percent will start on Monday in Washington as part of President Donald Trump's and the U.S. Trade Representative's efforts to pressure Beijing for sweeping changes to its trade and economic policies.  Unlike previous rounds of U.S. tariffs, which sought to shield consumers by targeting Chinese industrial machinery, electronic components and other intermediate goods, thousands of consumer products could be directly hit with tariffs by late September. The $200 billion list targets Chinese seafood, furniture and lighting products, tires, chemicals, plastics, bicycles and car seats for babies. (See the complete list https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USTR-2018-0026-0001) ""USTR’s proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports dramatically expands the harm to American consumers, workers, businesses, and the economy,"" the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in written testimony for the hearing. The top U.S. business lobbying group said the Trump administration lacks a ""coherent strategy"" to address China's theft of intellectual property and other harmful trade practices and called for ""serious discussions"" with Beijing. Mid-level Trump administration officials and their Chinese counterparts are expected to meet later this week in Washington to discuss their trade dispute. But it is unclear whether the talks will have any effect on the implementation of U.S. tariffs and retaliation by China. In more than 1,400 written comments submitted to USTR that will be echoed in the hearings, most businesses argued that the tariffs will cause harm and higher costs for products ranging from Halloween costumes and Christmas lights to nuclear fuel inputs, while a small number praised them or asked that they be extended to other products. Graco Children's Products Inc, a unit of Newell Brands Inc (N:NWL), said tariffs ""will have a direct negative impact on our company, American parents and most importantly the safety of American children."" The company said higher prices may prompt more parents to buy car seats, swings and portable play yards on the second-hand market. ""The proposed tariffs may force parents to use unsafe sleeping environments or let children dangerously co-sleep with parents,"" Graco wrote. The tariff ""only causes a children safety issue; it will not convince China to change its policies."" Evenflo Feeding said the tariffs will hit manual breast pumps ""and would cause disproportionate economic harm to U.S. interests."" At the other end of the life cycle, Centennial Casket Corp President Douglas Chen said his Plano, Texas-based company relies exclusively on Chinese-made caskets and the tariffs would cause ""great loss"" and raise costs for ""grieving families purchasing caskets for their loved ones at one of the worst times of their life.""  The Internet Association, representing companies including  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOG), said the tariffs ""would cause disproportionate economic harm to American internet companies. The list includes products that impact how internet companies function."" Westinghouse Electric Co LLC, the leading U.S. nuclear fuel producer, said it relies on China for zirconium and zirconium powders - key inputs for tubes used in nuclear fuel assemblies that it uses at plants in Utah, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. There is no U.S. source of zirconium so the tariff would ""raise the cost for Westinghouse to manufacture nuclear fuel for U.S. commercial nuclear power plants"" and it ultimately ""would increase the cost of electricity to a significant percentage of U.S. electricity consumers,"" the company said in a filing. Huffy Corp, the largest U.S. bicycle brand, with 4 million Chinese-made bikes sold annually, said a 25 percent tariff poses a ""serious threat to the company."" Huffy CEO Bill Smith wrote that the tariffs should have been put in place 20 years ago when Huffy and other U.S. bicycle makers sought to increase the 11 percent U.S. bicycle tariff because of aggressive Chinese imports. When this effort failed, Huffy closed three U.S. plants in 1998 and 1999, terminating 2,000 employees and shifting to Chinese bikes.  ""This proposed tariff is too little, too late,"" Smith wrote, adding that now, a higher tariff would ""only create problems"" and cost jobs at independent U.S. bicycle dealers. ""There is no other country in Asia or Europe that can provide the volume Huffy requires as China is the largest bicycle producer in the world,"" he said. U.S.-China Business Council President Craig Allen, speaking to reporters in Beijing on Monday, said more tariffs could create ""grave economic distortions"", but that Trump had been very clear about the problems in the trade relationship. ""They [Chinese officials] have been given these suggestions in writing. I think that they know very well what is being asked. And let the negotiations proceed,"" Allen said, calling for a ""surge"" in Chinese market opening.",-0.9772
https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/blackberry-closes-chapter-on-restructuring-process-:-internal-memo-300747,"Aug 05, 2014","By Euan Rocha  TORONTO (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd (TO:BB) has concluded a protracted and painful restructuring process and is back on a growth footing, according to an internal memo to all its employees viewed by Reuters.  ""We have completed the restructuring notification process, and the workforce reduction that began three years ago is now behind us,"" said the memo from BlackBerry's Chief Executive John Chen that was sent out on Friday.  ""More importantly, barring any unexpected downturns in the market, we will be adding headcount in certain areas such as product development, sales and customer service, beginning in modest numbers,"" said Chen, who personally thanked those that have stayed with the company through the process.  BlackBerry has shrunk its workforce by roughly 60 percent over the last three years as it attempts to reinvent itself. The company that dominated the smartphone market in its infancy has seen its sales dramatically eroded over the last four years by Apple's (O:AAPL) iPhone and a slew of rival devices powered by Google Inc's (O:GOOG) Android operating system.  Chen, who took the reins at BlackBerry roughly eight months ago, has moved rapidly to stabilize the company by selling non-core assets, partnering to make the company's manufacturing and supply chain more efficient, and raising cash via the sale of the company's extensive real estate holdings in its hometown of Waterloo, Ontario.  Chen, a well-regarded turnaround artist in the tech sector, intends to remain a competitor in the smartphone arena, but is focused on reshaping the company to build on its core strengths in areas like mobile data security and mobile device management.  In the memo, Chen told employees that he believes BlackBerry is now well on its way to recovery and that he is confident the company will meet its goal of being cash flow positive by the end of the current fiscal year.  He noted also BlackBerry, which had previously said it was trimming its workforce down to 7,000 from a peak of over 17,500 in 2011, is now in a position to make strategic acquisitions to strengthen areas that are likely to drive future revenue growth.  Last week, BlackBerry announced one such deal with a move to acquire Secusmart, a privately-held German firm specializing in voice and data encryption. The deal is expected to burnish its credentials with some of its highly security-conscious clients like government ‎agencies.  Chen, who is well known for having turned around enterprise software maker Sybase Inc in the late 1990s, told employees in the memo that he is confident BlackBerry now has the right organization and team in place to execute its business strategy.  Over the last few months, Chen has hired a number of former Sybase employees that helped engineer that turnaround before the company was sold to software giant SAP AG (DE:SAPG) in 2010.  
Chen stressed in the memo there was ""no margin for error to complete BlackBerry's turnaround to success"", and he called on employees to remain focused as the company rolls out an upgrade to its device management system and its new Passport and Classic devices this fall.

The closing purchase price is lower than the $2.3 billion announced in January because of a change in the valuation of inventory and deferred revenue liability, Lenovo said. Roughly $1.8 billion will be paid in cash and the remainder in stock.  The purchase is Lenovo's latest since overtaking Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) (N:HPQ) as the world's top personal computer (PC) maker last year, in its quest to diversify away from a steadily shrinking PC market. Earlier this year, Lenovo also said it would pay $2.9 billion for Google Inc's (O:GOOG) Motorola smartphone unit.  In an interview, Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said the IBM deal opened a new ""growth engine"" for his company. He said he expected the x86 unit to bring in $5 billion in its first year and deliver margins higher than the 4 percent of Lenovo's PC business.  ""In the large and medium enterprise space we can now fully leverage IBM technology to compete with brands like HP and Dell,"" Yang said by telephone. ""We can combine this good technology with Lenovo's efficient operations.""  IBM's x86 server business has trailed those of HP and Dell Inc [DI.UL] in market share. But Yang said Lenovo has expertise competing in markets with razor-thin margins, gained during its journey to becoming the world's largest PC maker.  Lenovo currently sells a line of low-end servers under the ThinkServer brand, but the company pursued IBM's x86 portfolio because its higher-end machines can perform more complex analytics and database-related functions.  The x86 server team will continue to be led by former IBM executive Adalio Sanchez, who will report to Gerry Smith, president of Lenovo's enterprise business group, Lenovo said in a statement announcing the deal's impending closure.  Some observers expected the deal would take longer to close because of uncertainty about how U.S. regulators might respond to a Chinese company buying a server business during a time of cyber-security tensions between the United States and China.  Lenovo previously bought its consumer PC laptop business from IBM in 2005.

The Apple-IBM tie up, beginning this fall, is set to target the customer base that BlackBerry needs to woo as part of a turnaround under new Chief Executive Officer John Chen.
""It is not a crushing blow at this early stage, but ‎it is a negative for BlackBerry,"" said IDC analyst John Jackson. ""There can be little question that it is unwelcome, if not entirely unexpected news.""
BlackBerry's stock has been on a tear this year. As of Tuesday, it was up more than 50 percent as some investors became more optimistic about the company's future.
News of the Apple-IBM venture took some of the steam out of the stock on Wednesday.
BlackBerry shares fell 9.4 percent to $10.24 on Nasdaq and 9.3 percent to C$11.03 on the Toronto Stock Exchange after analysts said the alliance could hurt the turnaround plans.
IBM said late Tuesday the tie-up will offer services geared toward security and mobile device management, an area viewed as BlackBerry's strong suit and a key selling point in its battle to win back market share from the iPhone and devices powered by Google Inc's (O:GOOG) Android software.
""The partnership's software around data security and device
management pose immediate threats to mobile device management (MDM) software solutions deployed by firms such as BlackBerry and MobileIron (O:MOBL),"" said Morningstar analyst Brian Colello in a note to clients.
""Even if Apple-IBM's security 'mousetrap' isn't as good as ones offered by BlackBerry and others, these MDM vendors will
have to overcome the extremely high hurdle of displacing IBM's mobile device software preloaded on iPhones and iPads.""
BlackBerry downplayed the threat posed by the alliance.
""The news that Apple is partnering with IBM to expand into the enterprise mobility market only underscores the ongoing need for secure end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions like those BlackBerry has delivered for years,"" said the company in a brief statement.

BlackBerry said it remained the leader in this market, with the necessary software and network to secure data for enterprise clients.
UBS analyst Amitabh Passi warned, however, that competition for Blackberry in the enterprise mobile management market is set to intensify after recent deals such as IBM's acquisition of Fiberlink, VMware's takeover of AirWatch and the Citrix-Zenprise deal.
""Blackberry now finds itself competing against much larger and established enterprise vendors, as well as smaller, but better capitalized vendors like Mobileiron,"" said Passi in a note to clients.
The shares of Mobileiron Inc (O:MOBL), a small recently listed player in the sector, also fell sharply - down nearly 6 percent at $8.16 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) foray into consumer health care could help the tech giant's plans to diversify its revenue base, easing its dependence on iPhone revenue growth, as the U.S. health care opportunity is estimated to be three times larger than the global smartphone market, Morgan Stanley said in a note Monday.
The bank's upbeat assessment of Apple's chances to emerge as a leader in consumer health is driven by the company's track record of disrupting industries.
""Health care is a market where Apple has the potential to lead digital disruption – much like what iTunes did for music or the App Store for mobile services,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. ""Based on what it has done over the last five years, we see Apple creating the building blocks of another ecosystem” that puts the consumer at the center.
Apple's move into health care comes at time when wearables and electronic medical records are enabling data to flow more freely between silos and stakeholders, the bank added. Apple's watch and iPhone positions the company as an ""agent of change"" in health care and a leader among tech companies entering the space.

https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-in-rally-mode-as-move-lower-enticed-bargain-hunters-1891945,"Jun 07, 2019","Investing.com - Bitcoin soared Friday as bargain hunters piled into the popular crypto after its earlier-day plunge to key support levels.
Bitcoin rose nearly 6% to $8,105, up from a low of $7,450. The popular crypto's move above the key $8,000 level comes a day after a plunge toward the low $7,000 area attracted a wave of buyers.
Despite the sunnier end to the week, Bitcoin remains in correction territory, down about 11.1% from its year-to-date peak of $9,100, and looks set to snap its 10-week winning streak.
While traders were hard pressed to find a specific reason for the rally, some attributed the move to growing expectations that Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) soon-to-be launched cryptocurrency will ramp up institutional demand.
""(Facebook's crypto launch) puts competitors on notice. What’s Google, Apple, Amazon), Tencent, Rakuten, Alibaba… what are they going to do now if Facebook launches a coin that gets traction around the world?"" Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer at BitPay, told Bloomberg.
Following the rally, bitcoin's total market cap, often use to gauge demand, jumped to $143 billion from about $136 billion a day earlier.
The surge in bitcoin saw demand for other cryptos gather pace as XRP/USD rose 7.54% to $0.42695, ETH/USD climbed 4.62% to $252.93 and LTC/USD surged 16% to $119.21.",0.827
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stocks--dow-falls-nearly-300-points-as-red-october-continues-1662211,"Oct 26, 2018","Investing.com - The Dow tumbled on Friday, shrugging off data showing ongoing U.S. economic growth as high-flying tech companies were punished in the wake of downbeat reports from Google and Amazon.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 1.19%. The S&P 500 fell 1.73%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.07%. The three indexes are on track for their worst month in years.
Investors grappled with wild swings on Wall Street amid growing concerns U.S. corporates were approaching peak profit growth after tech heavyweights Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered underwhelming quarterly reports and signalled a softer patch of growth for the fourth quarter.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 1.80% after it posted third-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations. Amazon shares, meanwhile, dropped nearly 8% as its third-quarter revenue also fell short, while its weaker-than-expected guidance for the key holiday season exacerbated concerns.
The S&P 500 tech sector closed about 2% lower, while the communication services sector, which includes Netflix, Facebook, Alphabet and telecom companies sunk more than 2%.
The pair of downbeat reports overshadowed data showing the U.S. economy grew 3.5% in the third quarter, above economists' estimates for a 3.3% increase, though analysts said a deeper look into the data revealed signs of a possible slowdown.
Disappointing business investment suggested ""the boost in capex from tax cuts and deregulation was likely front-loaded and fading quickly,"" BNP Paribas said. ""We continue to expect growth to slow from here as the sugar high in consumer spending turns into a sugar low.""
Energy, meanwhile, was also caught up in the selling frenzy, falling nearly 1%, exacerbating the decline in the broader market as a rise in oil prices Friday failed to offset a loss of more than  3% for the week.
Building-products companies were also under pressure, led by a more-than-20% drop in shares of  Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK) after its third-quarter earnings came up short of estimates and fourth-quarter earnings per share guidance of $2.45 to $2.60 was nearly 30% below the consensus estimate at the midpoint.
Shares of Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS), Fortune Brands Home & Security (NYSE:FBHS) and  Johnson Controls  International (NYSE:JCI) also fell.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) retreated from session highs, but still managed a 5% gain, shrugging off a report from the WSJ claiming the FBI launched a criminal probe into whether the electric automaker had misstated production figures and misled investors.

Pichette joined Google in 2008 after spending seven years at Bell Canada, where he held a variety of positions including chief financial officer from 2002-2003. Prior to working at Bell, Pichette served as a partner at McKinsey & Company where he was a lead member of the company's North American Telecom Practice. Pichette holds a master's degree from Oxford University in politics, philosophy and economics, where he attended as a Rhodes' Scholar.
In January, Pichette expressed pessimism in regards to the future of Google Glass during a fourth quarter earnings call. Google temporarily discontinued the Glass Explorer program on Jan. 19.
“When teams aren’t able to leap hurdles, but we think there’s still a lot of promise, we might ask them to take a pause and take the time to reset their strategy, as we recently did in the case of Glass,” Pichette said. “In those situations where projects don’t have the impact we hope for, we do take the tough calls, we make the decision to cancel them, and you’ve seen us do this time and time again.”
More recently, Pichette blamed a stronger dollar for some of the company's revenue losses. The strengthening of the dollar, Pichette said, was responsible for creating $400 million in losses for Google.

"https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/recount-effort-fails-in-wisconsin,-as-trump-gains-votes-447583","Dec 13, 2016","Investing.com - President-elect Donald Trump told supporters in suburban Milwaukee this evening that the Democrats were behind the Green Party's election recount effort in the state of Wisconsin, a now-failed effort that he called a ""scam.""
Losing candidate Jill Stein, the nominee of the communist-linked Green Party, earned just 1% of the vote in the November election, and fell even further behind Trump and Hillary Clinton after the recount she requested was completed yesterday.
""The recount vote has come back,"" said Trump, speaking in West Allis, Wis. ""After millions were wasted. and countless hours spent. I refuse to say it was a scam. But after all this money was spent by the Democrats, and believe me they were behind this, we added 131 votes more than we had before. I think it was worth it. What did they spend, $4 million? That's okay. It tells you how important every vote is.""
Trump added that Brexit -- the British exit from the European Union -- was ""a small version"" of what ""we've done here. I predicted Brexit, but the media won't acknowledge that.""
The Wisconsin recount, many analysts posit, was just one of many failed attempts by the opposition party to discredit Trump after his stunning election victory last month in the U.S. presidential election.
Another effort to tarnish Trump's triumph is still underway, but is clearly losing momentum in the media and in the intelligence bureaucracy in the U.S.
Democratic allies of Clinton are claiming that Russian hackers ""influenced"" the U.S. election by releasing sordid e-mail messages from Clinton campaign staff through WikiLeaks.
""The Russians have been trying to influence our elections since the Soviet era,"" said President Obama, in a TV interview aired today.
At issue: a phishing attack on Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's Gmail account was so effective that it even fooled the campaign's sophisticated IT personnel.
Released as part of the WikiLeaks trove, the e-mail was initially sent to Podesta's Gmail account on March 16, 2016. Clinton campaign staff advised that the e-mail was ""legitimate,"" and counseled Podesta, a lawyer, and former White House chief of staff, to reset his account password, as requested by the hackers.
An examination of the return mailing address on the fake e-mail to Podesta shows an account labeled: ""no-reply@accounts.googlemail.com.""
The subject line of the e-mail advises, ""Someone has your password"" and the body of the message says ""someone"" in Ukraine tried, but was prevented from signing into the account of Podesta, said to be Hillary Clinton's campaign mastermind.
Earlier, the same group that hacked the Clinton campaign and its unsecured Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) server, a black hat outfit called ""Fancy Bear,"" also apparently hacked the Obama White House. The IT team there -- staffed with former Silicon Valley technologists -- did not detect the phishing infiltration.
""We will not be taken advantage of by other nations,"" said Trump, on the stump in Wisconsin this evening.",0.2563

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/alphabet-sheds-2.6-in-after-hours-trade-amid-profit-slump-509268,"Jul 24, 2017","Investing.com - Google’s parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported a 27.7% drop in quarterly profit, following the $2.74 billion regulatory fine levied by the European Union.
Alphabet reported net income of $3.52 billion, or $5.01 per share on $26.01 billion in revenue, compared to net income of $4.88 billion or earnings of $4.49 per share on $21.5 billion in revenue a year ago.
Analysts were expecting Alphabet to report earnings of $4.49 per share on revenue of $25.6 billion.
Despite earnings that topped expectations on both the bottom and top line, shares of Alphabet slipped more than 2% in after hours trade, as the tech giant recognised a non-deductible $2.74 billion European Union fine in its results, lowering profit.
Excluding the one-time charge, Google said it earned $8.90 per share.
Alphabet Chief Financial Officer hailed the quarter a success pointing to an uptick in revenues and signalled the company would continue to invest in opportunities that will spur top-line growth.
""With revenues of $26 billion, up 21% versus the second quarter of 2016 and 23% on a constant currency basis, we're delivering strong growth with great underlying momentum, while continuing to make focused investments in new revenue streams,"" said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet.",0.9887
