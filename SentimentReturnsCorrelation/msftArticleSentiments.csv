https://www.investing.com/analysis/msft-continues-buyback-frenzy-200466332,,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is up almost 2% today after the board announced the approval of a $40 billion stock buyback program and an 11% dividend increase. Microsoft is the most cash (& cash equivalent) rich company in the market and has been buying back its own stock for almost a decade.
Stock buybacks are hitting record highs as companies with excessive amounts of cash on hand want to keep shareholders happy with short-term share appreciation. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) , Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) , and Microsoft rank amongst the largest stock repurchasers of 2019 so far.

Through the first half of the year, Apple bought back $42 billion in its shares, while Oracle repurchased $16.3 billion, and Microsoft purchased over $9 billion in its own shares. 2018 marked an all-time high for stock repurchases with a market total of over $800 billion stock buybacks.
AAPL has bought back roughly a quarter trillion dollars’ worth of its own stock over the past 5-years, while Oracle and Microsoft come in at over $70 billion in the same time frame.
These are some of the most cash rich companies in the world, but are they putting their cash to good use?
Productive Use of Money
Are share buybacks the most productive use of funds for producing long term shareholder returns? There are a few sides to this coin and they are very circumstantial. There are three things that a company can do with the cash on their balance sheet, one is let it sit in some low interest earning account, be used as commercial paper, or be put in some other fixed income vehicle. This will have very little effect on a stock price because this is what is expected from a cash pile on a company’s balance sheet.
The next thing that a company can do with extra cash is to invest in either organic developments like R&D or sales & marketing, or in a productive acquisition (full or partial). Cash used in this manner is typically the most advantageous for all stakeholders, as long as the investments have robust ROIs (return on investment). In an environment where valuations are high, acquisitions and R&D are more expensive than the projected returns. This avenue would not be the most productive use of cash.
The final use of cash that I will discuss is giving it directly back to the shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This use of capital will boost short-term share prices, but will it have a long-term positive effect for shareholders? A consistent dividend is a sign that a company has matured and expects a reliable stream of income moving forward. Dividends are good for a stock stability if the firm is able to maintain its dividend yield.
Stock repurchase programs will have the same short-term stock price boost as an additional dividend, but the difference is that it is not typically consistent and will only create shareholder value if the shares bought are undervalued. Buying back stock when the intrinsic worth of the stock is below its current price will deteriorate shareholder value.
Back to Microsoft 
Microsoft is trading at its all-time high right now and its forward P/E has been surging over the last 5 years as investors become more excited about Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure. Should Microsoft be buying back its own relatively expensive stock, or should the company be investing more in its cloud platform? The firm could be using the cash to further consolidate the cloud market through savvy acquisition of small cloud firms.
Like I said, high valuations make acquisitions a less attractive play and valuations in the tech industry are slightly high currently. There is only so much money that a company can poor into its R&D department before they start losing marginal value.
Though, buying stock back at all-time highs doesn’t look great for long term shareholder value, especially when its forward P/E is the highest its been in over a decade.
Take Away
I am not a big fan of companies throwing their extra cash back at the shareholders when there is still a substantial amount of growth potential. In my opinion, these tech stocks should be focusing on advancing technology and in turn humanity, instead of being worried about short-term share price boosts.
Stocks like AAPL and ORCL have shown little to no top or bottom-line growth this year but their stock price still seems to appreciate. This is primarily due to their stock buyback programs. Some of these tech companies use buybacks as merely a way to preserve their stock’s attractiveness.
There is a time and place where stock buybacks are appropriate such as when the stock price is undervalued and there are no more productive uses for the money, but this can still be speculative.

https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-old-tech-%E2%80%94-msft-%E2%80%94-topping-214903,,"As of late, all I hear is people in the media talking about the move in old tech stocks, and how new money should be put to work in names such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) and so on. This should make you wonder, why where the talking heads not saying this while these stocks were 10, 20 and in some cases, over 30% off their highs? At the beginning of 2013, MSFT Microsoft was trading at only $26.28. Since then, the stock has been one of the new leaders in the market, reaching a high of $41.66 earlier this year. That is an unbelievable run, especially for a company of the size of MSFT.Looking back in time, yes MSFT was a great bargain at those levels. But remember something important, back then no one wanted to buy MSFT, or so they claimed on the different media outlets. As traders and investors we must always be aware of what is behind the words of these media talking heads. Their main goal is to create hype and get the small investor caught up in the moment. The reason they do that is simple, ratings! They are hosting TV shows, they need people to watch their shows. Or maybe they are selling newspapers, well, someone needs to buy the papers folks. Institutions know the role of the media all too well and use it to feed the public information for their benefit; so they can sell their shares at the highs and buy them back at the lows. For this one simple reason, you should never chase any equity. If a stock has run up on the back of media hype, run away! Learn how to utilize the charts to your advantage by reading them correctly and you will allow yourself to be a buyer when institutions are buying and a seller when they sell. Let's take a look at Microsoft's chart below and see what it is telling us regarding buying or selling the equity now:Microsoft
As you can see, MSFT peaked at a high of $41.66, and it is now trading just a little below that high at $40.79. The PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) Trust recently reached a multi year high of $91.45. However, as noted by the chart above, MSFT has put in lower highs and recently made a new lower low at $38.51, before rallying back intra day to close above an important support level at $38.98.This is bearish for the equity, and perhaps a sign of distribution. If MSFT closes below $38.51 on a daily basis, it should quickly fall further. This equity should not be chased at these levels. A level that could be in play for a short term move up from is $37.18. Another level that you can keep on your buy list and will offer an opportunity for a longer term hold, will be the $35.04, depending on how and if MSFT gets there.

Under the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), five major U.S. tech companies — Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) — were designated ""gatekeeper"" service providers. From March 2024, these companies — as well as TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance — will be required to make their messaging apps work with rivals and let users choose which ones they want pre-installed on their devices. In a letter seen by Reuters, 21 members of the U.S. House of Representatives warned the new rules could damage American economic and security interests and called on Biden to secure commitments from the EU the rules will be enforced fairly. ""Securing our leadership in this sector is imperative for our economy and American workers,"" the letter said. ""The designation of leading U.S. companies as 'gatekeepers' threatens to upend the U.S. economy, diminish our global leadership in the digital sphere, and jeopardize the security of consumers.""  The European Commission and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Europe is seen by some experts as the global leader in tech regulation. The bloc's DMA and the DSA (Digital Services Act) are attempts at tailoring laws to target the Big Tech companies.  The letter questioned why Chinese companies  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Huawei, and Tencent had avoided designation and why European companies had avoided any scrutiny. ""The EU inexplicably failed to designate any European retailers, content-sharing platforms, payment firms, and telcos,"" it said. Signatories of the letter — including Representative Lou Correa, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Republican, — called on Biden to seek assurances from EU lawmakers the DMA will not be unfairly used to target U.S. companies.  
The U.S. government has previously warned the EU against over-regulating American technology companies. When the DMA was still being drafted, the White House National Security Council told EU representatives that using the bill to solely target American companies would hinder their ability to work together. Since 2021, the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council (TTC) has sought to harmonise technology regulation on either side of the Atlantic, with lawmakers seeking consensus on topics such as supply chain security, export controls and foreign investment.",0.6705
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ibm-expands-ai-and-cloud-capabilities-with-23-billion-software-ag-deal-3259349,"Dec 18, 2023","Quiver Quantitative -  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) is set to enhance its portfolio in the artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud domains with the acquisition of Software AG's enterprise integration platforms. This deal, valued at approximately 2.13 billion euros ($2.33 billion), involves the purchase of the StreamSets and webMethods platforms from Software AG. These platforms, integral to Software AG's ""Super Ipaas"" business, offer a range of functionalities including application integration, API management, and data integration. The acquisition, funded through IBM's available cash, underscores the tech giant's commitment to expanding its capabilities in critical tech areas.
Software AG, under the majority ownership of private equity firm Silver Lake, has seen significant financial maneuvers in recent times. Silver Lake, which currently holds 93.3% of Software AG's shares, had valued the company at 2.6 billion euros ($2.84 billion) following a protracted takeover process. This acquisition by IBM of specific Software AG platforms is a strategic move that promises to leverage the strengths of both entities in the evolving tech landscape.
Market Overview:
-IBM makes a strategic move, acquiring Software AG's StreamSets and webMethods platforms for €2.13 billion to boost its hybrid cloud and AI offerings.
-The deal strengthens IBM's position in the critical enterprise integration and data management space.
-Cash-funded purchase complements Silver Lake's ongoing takeover of Software AG, valuing the entire company at €2.6 billion.
Key Points:
-IBM focuses on the ""Super Ipaas"" business launched by Software AG in October, gaining key tools for application integration, API management, and data flow.
-This acquisition bolsters IBM's Cloud Paks hybrid cloud offerings and complements its Watson AI platform, creating a more comprehensive solution for businesses.
-Software AG shareholders, primarily private equity firm Silver Lake, rejoice as the €32 per share delisting offer adds another chapter to their successful takeover.
Key Points:
-Regulatory approvals expected in the second quarter of 2024 mark the hurdle before integration begins.
-The combined offering is expected to attract enterprises seeking streamlined cloud migrations and enhanced data-driven processes.
-IBM faces growing competition in the hybrid cloud and AI space, with players like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services vying for market share.
Christian Lucas, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Software AG, expressed enthusiasm about the potential innovation that the merger of StreamSets and webMethods teams with IBM could bring. The focus is on creating cutting-edge hybrid cloud and AI solutions for enterprises, marking a significant step in the tech industry's ongoing evolution. The transaction, still subject to regulatory approvals, is anticipated to finalize in the second quarter of 2024, setting the stage for new developments in enterprise technology solutions.
Silver Lake's involvement in this transaction is further highlighted by its concurrent announcement of a delisting offer for Software AG at 32 euros ($34.96) per share. This move, following its acquisition of a controlling stake in the company, represents the next phase in Software AG's corporate trajectory under Silver Lake's stewardship. This IBM-Software AG deal, therefore, not only signifies a major shift in enterprise tech solutions but also marks a notable moment in the broader context of tech industry mergers and acquisitions.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pro-research-wall-street-takes-a-closer-look-at-qualcomm-3249379,"Dec 05, 2023","In the bustling semiconductor industry, QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands out as a key player, particularly known for its wireless technology prowess and a strong foothold in the smartphone market. With the industry at a critical juncture, marked by rapid technological advancements and shifting market dynamics, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s strategic moves and financial health are under intense scrutiny. This analysis delves into the company's performance, product segments, competitive landscape, market trends, regulatory environments, and management strategies, aiming to provide potential investors with a comprehensive understanding of Qualcomm's position and prospects.Company Profile and Market PositionQualcomm's reputation in the digital wireless communications equipment sector is formidable, thanks to its intellectual property in CDMA and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access technologies. The company's integrated circuits, based on CDMA technology, are essential for a range of applications, including workforce tracking, asset management, and wireless content enablement. Qualcomm's market position is further bolstered by its Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF Systems, which are integral to the current and upcoming smartphone launches.Strategic Partnerships and AgreementsA significant feather in Qualcomm's cap is the extension of its supply agreement with tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which now runs through FY27. This deal is not just about numbers; it's a testament to Qualcomm's technological leadership and the strategic importance of its products. Analysts view this extended partnership as a bridge to a more diversified revenue profile for Qualcomm, particularly in the automotive sector, with the potential to create sustainable earnings and robust annual cash flow.Financial Health and Stock PerformanceThe financial estimates paint a positive picture, with adjusted diluted EPS showing a steady climb from the actual FY22 figure of $12.53 to an estimated $10.93 in FY25. Qualcomm's stock has demonstrated resilience, with a 4% uptick year-to-date, although it has seen an 11% decline over the last twelve months. Trading at a multiple below its five-year average, the company appears undervalued relative to its earnings power, according to analysts.Product Segments and DiversificationBeyond handsets, Qualcomm has been making inroads into the automotive and PC markets. The company's long-term optionality is a standout, with secure design wins in auto and potential in PCs. Qualcomm's exclusivity agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for Arm-based Windows PCs, set to expire in 2024, is a key area of focus. The Snapdragon Summit, starting October 24, is expected to shed light on Qualcomm's strategies in this segment post-exclusivity period.Competitive Landscape and Market TrendsThe competitive landscape for Qualcomm is complex, with the handset market nearing a cyclical trough after a prolonged period of inventory correction. Qualcomm's edge lies in its long-term agreements and diversification efforts, which provide a cushion against the intense competition as 5G matures. However, the company must navigate the risks of a permanent Android share loss to Apple and the pressure to use domestic suppliers in China.Regulatory Environment and External FactorsQualcomm's reliance on third-party foundries introduces risks, such as potential production limitations or increasing costs. Additionally, the company must contend with the challenges of enforcing essential patent licenses. Economic slowdowns, affecting consumer and corporate spending on smartphone upgrades, also pose a threat to Qualcomm's revenue streams.Bear CaseAre Qualcomm's handset revenues at risk?The handset segment, despite being a major revenue generator for Qualcomm, faces long-term risks from increased competition and the maturation of 5G technology. As 5G technology becomes more widespread, the entry of new players could dilute Qualcomm's market share, affecting its profitability and unit shipments. Moreover, a shift in market preference towards Apple's devices could shrink Qualcomm's total addressable market, impacting its long-term revenue potential in the handset business.Can Qualcomm sustain growth amid economic headwinds?Qualcomm's reliance on the broader smartphone market, which is currently experiencing pressures, raises concerns about its ability to sustain growth. An economic downturn could lead to reduced consumer and corporate spending on smartphone upgrades, directly impacting Qualcomm's bottom line. Additionally, operational expenditure improvements may be limited, as maintaining the Apple business requires significant resources, potentially constraining profitability.Bull CaseHow will Qualcomm's agreement with Apple impact its future?The extended supply agreement with Apple is a significant win for Qualcomm, ensuring a stable revenue stream and reinforcing its position in the iPhone ecosystem until at least 2026. This deal is expected to contribute substantially to Qualcomm's earnings, with an estimated $1.50 added to EPS from the Apple QCT business alone. The agreement also underscores Qualcomm's technological prowess and its ability to secure long-term commitments from industry giants.Does Qualcomm have growth potential beyond smartphones?Qualcomm's diversification strategy, particularly its forays into the automotive and PC sectors, positions the company for growth beyond its traditional smartphone market. The company's expertise in modem development, especially amidst evolving 5G standards, provides it with a competitive edge. With secure design wins in the auto industry and potential in PCs, Qualcomm has multiple avenues for revenue expansion and EPS reacceleration.SWOT AnalysisStrengths:
- Strong supply agreement with Apple extending through FY27.
- Technological leadership in CDMA and 5G Modem-RF Systems.
- Diversification into automotive and PC sectors.
Weaknesses:
- Exposure to risks from the maturation of 5G technology.

Qualcomm's commitment to shareholder returns is evident, with the company having raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years, a testament to its financial stability and confidence in future cash flows.

From an investment standpoint, Qualcomm's market capitalization stands at a robust $159.7 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the industry.

HP Inc. competes with giants such as Dell (NYSE:DELL), Lenovo, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the PC market, while in the printer segment, its rivals include Canon and Epson.

The company is also focusing on structural improvements in the print segment, shifting towards subscriptions and profit-upfront models, which are anticipated to bolster operating profit growth.Financial Outlook and Analyst ProjectionsThere is a consensus among analysts that HP Inc. is expected to see a return to growth in the PC market by 2024, with replacement cycles and the end of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows 10 support in October 2025 acting as catalysts. Despite this, there are concerns about the print segment, where the company faces challenges from generic competitors and slow growth in new markets like 3D printing.
The company's financial execution has been strong, with revenue and earnings growth post-separation from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). HP Inc. has increased its market share over time and has been recognized for its innovative product development.Analyst Ratings and Price TargetsThe ratings and price targets for HP Inc. have varied, with some firms maintaining a cautious stance due to anticipated weakness in the PC and Print end markets through the first half of 2024. However, recent upgrades to Buy ratings from other firms, including Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC which upgraded from Equal-weight to Overweight and increased the price target from $31.00 to $35.00 on December 12, 2023, reflect a more optimistic view based on improvements in the PC ecosystem, cost reductions, and attractive valuations. The upgrade from Morgan Stanley was influenced by confidence in HP's ability to capitalize on improving market conditions and its undervalued cyclicals with strong operational efficiency. Price targets from analysts range from $23 to $35, reflecting the mixed outlook on the company's future performance.Bear CaseWill HP Inc.'s market challenges lead to underperformance?Analysts have expressed concerns about the persistent weakness in the PC and Print end markets, which are expected to continue affecting HP Inc.'s performance at least through the first half of 2024.

Analysts worry that the company's growth expectations for Print hardware may be overly optimistic, and the operating margins in this segment are already at the high end of the new guidance range, which could make consistent profit growth difficult to achieve.Bull CaseHow could AI integration and PC market improvements boost HP Inc.'s revenues?Analysts are optimistic about the PC market's recovery, with AI integration expected to catalyze revenue growth. HP Inc.'s focus on AI could lead to increased average selling prices and drive a conservative long-term guide for the Personal Systems segment. Additionally, market share gains and positive supply chain commentary suggest an improving demand environment for PCs.What are the prospects for HP Inc.'s cost reductions and shareholder returns?Significant cost reductions are expected to support margin and earnings recovery for HP Inc. Analysts also anticipate higher free cash flow generation, which could result in increased share buybacks and enhanced shareholder returns. The company's undemanding valuations and prospects for higher free cash flow generation are seen as bullish indicators.SWOT AnalysisStrengths:

The stock has received positive ratings from analysts, with price targets suggesting confidence in Microsoft's future prospects.Bear CaseIs Microsoft's AI strategy a risk to its cloud dominance?The company's aggressive push into AI, while seen as a growth driver, could also present risks.

AWS, as a standalone product segment, has been instrumental in establishing Amazon's dominance in the cloud services market. AWS's comprehensive suite of services, including computing power, storage solutions, and AI capabilities, has attracted a diverse customer base, ranging from startups to large enterprises.
The digital streaming and AI segments are increasingly becoming focal points for Amazon. Initiatives such as Prime Video and the development of Alexa's conversational abilities highlight the company's commitment to integrating AI into its services and improving the user experience.Competitive Landscape and Market TrendsThe competitive landscape for Amazon is multifaceted, with the company facing challenges across its various operations. In e-commerce, Amazon continues to fend off competition from traditional retailers and digital upstarts alike. The rise of Chinese retail platforms like Shein and Temu has introduced new competitive dynamics, although Amazon's robust supply chain and delivery advantages have helped it maintain its market leadership.
In cloud computing, AWS competes directly with other tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). While AWS has been a leader in scale and innovation, it operates in a market where competitors are also heavily investing in their cloud offerings, particularly in the realm of AI and machine learning.
The digital advertising space sees Amazon going head-to-head with established players like Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:META). However, Amazon's unique position as an e-commerce platform provides it with valuable consumer data that enhances its advertising capabilities. The company's advertising platform is still in the early stages of development, and the extension of Sponsored Product ads beyond Amazon and the monetization of Prime Video ads by 2024 present new revenue opportunities, as noted by Wedbush Securities.Regulatory EnvironmentsRegulatory scrutiny remains a persistent theme for Amazon. The company has faced investigations and legal challenges in various jurisdictions over its business practices. These include antitrust concerns related to its marketplace operations and potential anti-competitive behavior. While Amazon has navigated these issues with a degree of success, the regulatory environment continues to pose risks that could impact the company's strategic flexibility and operational efficiency.Customer Base and ManagementAmazon boasts a vast and diverse customer base, with over 300 million active customers as of March 2022. This customer base is a testament to the company's ability to attract and retain shoppers through competitive pricing, a broad selection of products, and a focus on convenience.
The company's management team has been pivotal in steering Amazon through various market cycles and challenges. Their strategic decisions, from expanding into new markets like healthcare to optimizing the company's vast fulfillment network, have played a crucial role in Amazon's sustained growth.Strategy and External FactorsAmazon's strategy revolves around continuous innovation, customer-centricity, and expansion into new markets. The company's investments in AI and machine learning are indicative of its long-term vision to remain at the forefront of technological advancements. Additionally, Amazon's approach to physical retail, through acquisitions and the launch of new store formats, reflects its understanding of the evolving retail landscape.
External factors such as macroeconomic conditions, consumer spending patterns, and technological shifts have a significant impact on Amazon's operations. The company has shown an ability to adapt to these factors, as evidenced by its strategic cost structure adjustments and focus on high-margin segments like AWS and digital advertising.Upcoming Product LaunchesAmazon continues to innovate with upcoming product launches that span across its business segments. In the AI domain, the company is rumored to be working on an improved large language model codenamed ""Olympus,"" which could enhance its AI capabilities. The expansion of its generative AI offerings and the introduction of new services in AWS are expected to drive efficiency and cost savings for customers.
In the consumer hardware space, Amazon's hardware event previews and the rollout of new Alexa capabilities with generative AI demonstrate the company's commitment to integrating cutting-edge technology into its consumer products.Analyst Outlooks and ReasoningsAnalysts remain optimistic about Amazon's growth prospects, citing the company's strong position in its respective markets and the potential for margin expansion. While there are concerns about the competitive pressures in cloud services and generative AI, Amazon's continuous efforts to innovate and reduce costs are expected to result in share gains over time.
The bullish outlook is further supported by Amazon's strategic partnerships, such as those with Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which facilitate the development and integration of AI technologies. Additionally, Amazon's advertising services continue to impress with high operating income margins, indicating a sustained growth path.
Conversely, the bearish perspectives are primarily centered around the competitive landscape and potential regulatory challenges. The emergence of new competitors in e-commerce and cloud computing could pose threats to Amazon's market share. Furthermore, cybersecurity risks and industry-wide increases in compute prices for reserved instances could impact the growth of AWS's security tools.Bear CaseIs Amazon facing significant competitive threats?The competitive landscape for Amazon is indeed intensifying, with new players such as Temu and Shein entering the e-commerce space and tech giants like Microsoft and Google ramping up their cloud offerings. These competitors could potentially erode Amazon's market share and challenge its dominance. Additionally, regulatory challenges and consumer price sensitivity add layers of complexity to Amazon's operations.Can Amazon maintain its cloud market leadership?While AWS continues to be a leader in cloud services, the pressure from competitors investing heavily in AI and machine learning capabilities cannot be overlooked. Amazon will need to continue innovating and offering cost-effective, high-performance solutions to maintain its market position and address any concerns regarding the durability of its growth in the face of such competition.Bull CaseWill Amazon's AI investments lead to growth acceleration?Amazon's commitment to AI, as evidenced by its investments and product launches, positions the company to potentially lead in generative AI and cloud computing. The development of new AI chips and services, along with strategic partnerships, could drive further efficiency and cost savings for AWS customers, leading to growth acceleration.Can Amazon's advertising segment sustain its momentum?The digital advertising segment presents a significant growth opportunity for Amazon. With the company's vast consumer data and the introduction of video ads on Prime Video, there is a strong potential for sustained momentum in advertising revenue, contributing to Amazon's overall profitability. Wedbush Securities highlights the secular tailwinds favoring retail media and the growth in Connected TV (CTV) and video ad formats within Amazon’s properties, suggesting a bright future for this segment.SWOT AnalysisStrengths:

The company's shares have outperformed large-cap software peers by over 20% in 2023. This performance is attributed to Salesforce's solid quarterly results, strategic partnerships, and innovative product offerings.Product Segments and DetailsSalesforce's product ecosystem, which includes customer service, marketing automation, analytics, and application development, has been central to its success. The company's strategic focus on AI and data cloud services, as exemplified by the early adoption of Einstein GPT copilots and the introduction of premium UE+ bundles, has driven substantial increases in customer spend. Salesforce's Data Cloud, featuring Mulesoft and Tableau, has shown impressive growth, indicating strong demand for its integrated services. The recent Salesforce World Tour event in NYC highlighted upcoming enhancements, including a Data Cloud Vector Database and Einstein Copilot, which aim to integrate unstructured data with structured data, leveraging technology from the Evergage acquisition.Competitive LandscapeSalesforce competes in a market teeming with innovation, where AI capabilities are increasingly becoming a differentiator. The company's emphasis on AI integration, particularly with its Einstein platform, positions it well against competitors. However, Salesforce faces challenges from other major players like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which also offer compelling CRM solutions. The expanded partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), introducing new features such as Apple Messaging, Apple Pay, and augmented reality capabilities within select Salesforce products, further intensifies the competitive dynamics.Market TrendsThe CRM market is evolving, with a growing emphasis on AI and data-driven decision-making.

The company's strategic partnerships, such as those with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and now Apple, and its shareholder-friendly capital policies, including a significant buyback program, reflect a commitment to sustainable growth.Potential Impacts of External FactorsWhile Salesforce has demonstrated resilience, the macroeconomic environment poses potential risks. The company's cautious tone regarding measured spending behavior suggests market hesitancy. Additionally, professional services have faced headwinds, which could impact future performance.Upcoming Product LaunchesSalesforce's product roadmap is exciting, with the introduction of new AI capabilities through the Einstein platform and Einstein Copilot. These products are expected to enhance Salesforce's CRM workflows and provide customers with powerful AI tools for customization. The anticipated beta release of the Data Cloud Vector Database and Einstein Copilot in February 2024 signals Salesforce's continued commitment to innovation.Stock PerformanceSalesforce's stock valuation is compared to large-cap SaaS peers, and the company trades at attractive EV/revenue and EV/FCF multiples. The stock has seen a significant year-to-date increase, reflecting the market's confidence in Salesforce's growth trajectory.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded Salesforce from Equal-weight to Overweight and raised the price target from $290.00 to $350.00, highlighting the company's significant operating margin expansion and its strong positioning for generative AI adoption.Bear CaseAre there risks to Salesforce's growth projections?While Salesforce has shown strong performance, there are concerns about its ability to sustain double-digit growth into the future. The cautious tone regarding spending behavior and the marginal decline in operating margin compared to the previous quarter suggest that there are risks to the company's growth projections. The company's long-term growth potential has been questioned, and some analysts have lowered their price targets reflecting these concerns. The actual impact of new product announcements on adoption rates is uncertain due to the early stage of customers' Data Cloud environments.Can Salesforce maintain its competitive edge in AI?Salesforce's AI advancements have been met with enthusiasm, but there is caution regarding the pace of AI adoption among customers. With competitors like Adobe and Microsoft also focusing on AI, Salesforce faces the challenge of maintaining its competitive edge. The company's ability to fully leverage generative AI and the potential challenges in disrupting established market shares in new verticals, such as life sciences, could impact its competitive positioning.Bull CaseWhat factors support a bullish outlook for Salesforce?Salesforce's robust demand for Mulesoft and Data Cloud services, early adoption of AI capabilities, and strategic focus on profitable growth post-shareholder activism support a bullish outlook. The company's raised operating margin guidance and strong cRPO growth suggest operational efficiency and resilience in the face of economic uncertainty. Large multi-cloud deals and product strength also indicate potential for sustained growth. Product enhancements could add significant value to sales, customer service, and marketing teams by integrating various data sources for improved customer interaction and support.How does Salesforce's innovation drive its market leadership?Salesforce's continuous product innovation, particularly in AI, positions it as a market leader in enterprise software.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pro-research-wall-streets-indepth-look-at-oracles-cloud-surge-3249382,"Dec 05, 2023","As Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) navigates through a transformative phase, its aggressive push into cloud services has caught Wall Street's attention. Analysts collectively acknowledge the company's significant strides in the cloud sector, particularly in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and its potential to reshape Oracle's growth trajectory. This deep-dive analysis will explore Oracle's performance across different markets, product segments, and competitive landscape, offering insights into the company's strategy and future outlook.Company Profile and Financial HealthOracle, a technology behemoth founded in 1977 and headquartered in Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, California, has been a cornerstone in the software industry. With a market capitalization now standing at approximately $322.249 billion, the company's financial health remains robust. Oracle's diverse portfolio includes databases, cloud-engineered systems, and enterprise software products, with its services offered through both cloud-based and on-premise deployments.
The company's stock, currently at USD 115.13, has demonstrated resilience, with a lower-than-average price movement, and it sustains a dividend yield of 1.4%. Analysts note that Oracle's P/E ratios are expected to contract from 21.9x in 2023 to 17.5x in 2025, indicating a favorable earnings outlook. However, recent revenue headwinds have led to a slight decrease in EPS estimates for FY2024 from $5.63 to $5.55 and a reduction in cash flow per share (CFPS) estimates from $3.96 to $3.50. The integration of Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) is anticipated to further bolster earnings growth, with Oracle's dividend outlook projected to rise, despite recent revenue headwinds at Cerner due to renegotiated contracts with the Veterans Affairs (VA).Cloud Business and Market PositionOracle's cloud business is a focal point of its growth strategy. Despite a notable slowdown in both IaaS and PaaS revenues, analysts predict strong cloud sales growth potential over the next several years, driven by high demand for cloud infrastructure services, particularly for AI model training. Oracle's OCI is competitive against industry giants like Azure, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS), offering potential savings of 20% to 40% over three years. The company regularly signs deals over $1 billion, with a recent infrastructure company proposing a $1.5 billion contract for AI training due to Oracle's competitive pricing.
Despite an uncertain macroeconomic environment and challenges such as tough comparisons with previous license sales, Oracle's financial guidance anticipates non-GAAP EPS growth from $5.55 in FY24 to $6.73 in FY26, on the back of consistent revenue growth. The company's valuation metrics, including a CY24E EV/revenue multiple of 6.7x, are in line with its large-cap technology peers.Competitive Landscape and Market TrendsOracle competes with industry leaders such as SAP, Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), and  MongoDB  (NASDAQ:MDB). The company's transition from licensing products to offering them on a subscription basis in the cloud is expected to improve profitability. Oracle's international revenues account for 45% of total revenues, and it maintains solid ratings from Standard & Poor's and Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
The competitive landscape is evolving with the rise of generative AI, where Oracle has established partnerships with key players like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Google. The company's focus on AI is reshaping its growth trajectory, with partnerships with digital natives and AI innovators positioning Oracle as a significant player in this space.Regulatory Environment and Customer BaseOracle's customer base spans various sectors, with the company's products being integral to enterprise software solutions. The regulatory environment has been conducive to Oracle's growth, with no major impediments noted by analysts. The company's ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, particularly in international markets, contributes to its stable customer base.Management and StrategyOracle's management has set ambitious targets, aiming for $65 billion in revenue by FY26, with operating margins of 45% and over 10% annualized EPS growth. The company's strategy includes interoperability and minimizing integration costs, a shift from its previous approach that is seen as partner-friendly. Oracle's aggressive assumptions, particularly from net new customers, suggest a total addressable market (TAM) of over $250 billion for IaaS opportunities.Potential Impacts of External FactorsExternal factors such as economic uncertainty and supply constraints in AI chips and data center construction could impact Oracle's growth. The company's valuation concerns based on EV/free cash flow metrics compared to peers and the potential failure of cloud products to offset on-premise decline are risks highlighted by analysts.Upcoming Product Launches and Stock PerformanceOracle's upcoming product launches, particularly in cloud services, are expected to drive revenue growth. The company's stock performance has outpaced the S&P 500 and the Russell 3000, indicating strong investor confidence in Oracle's growth prospects.Bear CaseIs Oracle's cloud growth sustainable?Analysts express concerns regarding the sustainability of Oracle's cloud growth. Risks include the potential failure of cloud products to offset the decline in on-premise sales, loss of market share to competitors, and a reduction in overall IT spending. Economic uncertainty may impact business operations, and revenue recognition could lag behind order signings in new ventures like AI and Health sectors. Valuation concerns based on EV/free cash flow metrics compared to peers also pose a challenge. The deceleration in cloud revenue growth and weaker non-strategic back-office SaaS revenues are additional concerns.Can Oracle maintain its competitive edge?While Oracle has shown strong AI momentum with over $4 billion in signed contracts related to its Gen2 Cloud, there are uncertainties about maintaining high growth rates due to supply constraints. The aggressive TAM, particularly from net new customers, may be overly optimistic. Questions about the ability to accelerate revenue growth and the darker days of the economic downturn yet to come could also affect Oracle's competitive edge. The long lead time between bookings and revenue generation in IaaS could impact short-term performance.Bull CaseWill Oracle's strategic partnerships drive growth?Oracle's expansion of its partnership with Microsoft and other tech giants emphasizes the importance of its technology being widely available. The company's strategy to become more partner-friendly and its interoperability approach may attract new customers seeking multi-cloud services. Large-scale contracts and customer engagements indicate robust business growth, with bullish projections on cloud revenue and the large TAM from Oracle's support base conversion and new infrastructure cloud customers. Oracle's leading market position in ERP is expected to be durable, and the infrastructure business, particularly IaaS excluding legacy hosting, and OCI Consumption showed strong year-over-year growth.Is Oracle's AI focus a game-changer?Oracle's positioning to be a significant player in AI could reshape its growth trajectory over the next 3-5 years. The company's broadening investor appetite for its role in AI, strong partnerships with leading digital and AI companies, and positive adjustments in revenue estimates due to underlying AI momentum suggest a bullish outlook. Oracle's AI-driven growth strategy and robust partnerships, despite a weaker Q2 outlook, indicate long-term revenue targets that reflect optimism about the company's trajectory.SWOT AnalysisStrengths:

This analysis is based on reports from September to December 2023.InvestingPro InsightsOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has been a consistent performer in the technology sector, and as investors consider the company's future, several InvestingPro Tips and real-time metrics offer a clearer picture of its investment potential. Notably, Oracle has raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years, signaling a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Additionally, Oracle has maintained dividend payments for 15 consecutive years, which is a testament to its financial stability and investor-friendly approach.
From a valuation standpoint, Oracle is trading at a high P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a current P/E ratio of 28.49. This could suggest that the stock is priced optimistically in terms of its earnings potential. Moreover, the company’s high Price / Book multiple of 75.51 as of the last twelve months leading up to Q2 2024, indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium for its assets relative to the book value.
In terms of performance, Oracle’s revenue growth has been slowing down recently, with a quarterly growth rate of just 5.43% in Q2 2024. This could be a point of concern for investors looking for rapid top-line expansion. However, the company’s gross profit margin remains strong at 71.88%, underscoring its ability to maintain profitability.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/activision-blizzard-settles-workplace-harassment-lawsuit-in-california-3258162,"Dec 15, 2023","(Reuters) -Activision Blizzard will pay roughly $50 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit by a California regulator that alleged the videogame maker discriminated against women employees, including denying them promotion opportunities and underpaying them. California's Civil Rights Department (CRD) had sued the ""Call of Duty"" maker after two years of investigation over allegations that it routinely underpaid and failed to promote female employees and condoned sexual harassment. The CRD will withdraw the allegations of systemic sexual harassment, according to the settlement agreement, seen by Reuters. The remaining allegations resolved by the agreement included that Activision discriminated against women, including by denying promotion opportunities and paying them less than men for doing substantially similar work, the CRD said in a statement on Friday.  Activision will take additional steps to ensure fair pay and promotion practices and provide monetary relief to women who were employees or contract workers in California between Oct. 12, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2020, as part of the agreement, which is subject to court approval, the CRD statement said. ""In the settlement agreement, the CRD expressly acknowledged that 'no court or independent investigation has substantiated any allegations that there has been systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI)',"" the videogame maker said in a statement on Friday.  
The company also said that no investigation substantiated that its board or chief executive acted improperly in handling instances of workplace misconduct. Activision, which was bought in October by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for nearly $69 billion, agreed in 2021 to pay up to $18 million to settle similar claims made by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.",0.8807
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/market-wrap-volatility-persists-amid-uncertain-federal-reserve-outlook-3258012,"Dec 15, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - The S&P 500 (SPY) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) experienced a period of subdued trading, influenced by comments from New York Federal Reserve President John Williams. Williams' remarks tempered the market's recent enthusiasm regarding potential rate cuts in the upcoming year. Despite the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady and indications of slowing inflation, Williams emphasized the ongoing focus on bringing inflation back to the 2% target, causing a reevaluation of the market's expectations for future Fed actions.
The market's reaction to these comments was evident, with the S&P 500 and the Dow fluctuating in response. However, the markets still anticipate a high likelihood of rate cuts in March and May 2023, as reflected in the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool. This week's dovish stance overall has prompted a rally in equities, positioning the S&P 500 for its longest weekly winning streak since September 2017.
Market Overview:
-U.S. stocks see tepid gains on Friday as Fed's Williams cools rate-cut enthusiasm, but major indices track for weekly wins.
-The S&P 500 eyes its longest weekly winning streak since 2017, buoyed by dovish pivot earlier this week.
-Defensive sectors like utilities and real estate struggle, while tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) & Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lift the Nasdaq (QQQ)
-Investor sentiment remains cautious amid mixed messages from the Fed and volatile derivatives expiry.
Key Points:
-New York Fed President John Williams' comments against aggressive rate cuts throw cold water on market optimism.
-Money markets still price in high chances of rate cuts next year, reflecting a disconnect between Fed and investor expectations.
-Despite the choppy session, major indices remain on track for weekly gains, driven by earlier dovish signals.
-A survey suggests U.S. business activity picked up in December, potentially easing recession fears.
-Upcoming ""triple witching"" expiry of derivatives contracts could add volatility to the market later in the day.
Looking Ahead:
-The Fed's tightrope walk between controlling inflation and calming market anxiety will continue to influence investor sentiment.
-Mixed economic data and potentially volatile derivatives expiry may lead to further market choppiness in the short term.
-The S&P 500's attempt to extend its longest winning streak in years will be closely watched as a gauge of investor confidence.
On Friday, a survey indicating increased domestic business activity in December provided a positive outlook, possibly easing concerns of a significant economic slowdown in the fourth quarter. The trading session was also influenced by the ""triple witching"" event, the simultaneous expiration of stock options, index options, and futures, which could introduce additional volatility.
In terms of stock movements, notable changes included a rise in Costco (NASDAQ:COST) shares after strong first-quarter results and a decline in Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) following a lower-than-expected annual same-store sales forecast. The tech sector, with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), supported the Nasdaq's gains. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) also saw notable increases, with Broadcom reaching a new record high.

Cherney (Reuters) - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger on Thursday said the company has no plans to spin out its contract chip manufacturing business. Gelsinger has moved Intel's manufacturing unit into what is now called Intel Foundry Services (IFS) that operates as a business within Intel. IFS will break out financials beginning in the second quarter of next year, Gelsinger said. Intel isn't yet prepared to break out IFS into a separate entity and list it, as it did with its Mobileye autonomous driving business and plans to with the programmable chip unit in the next two to three years. ""The idea of the internal foundry model, we think, is the right path for us in the current environment,"" Gelsinger said in an interview with Reuters. In some ways, Intel already operates two separate companies - a chip design business and a factory unit - in part to give its IFS customers confidence that Intel is a ""clean supplier"" of manufacturing capacity, Gelsinger said.  For the moment, there are distinct advantages by operating together, in part because most of the factory capacity is used by Intel at the moment, the CEO said. Gelsinger made the comments about Intel's manufacturing business at an event in New York that focused on PC chips with artificial intelligence features.  Running AI applications from far away data centers is too costly for the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and will have to be run on local PCs, Gelsinger said. 
""There isn't any possible way that they can have a billion Windows devices hitting Azure to be running these workloads in real time,"" Gelsinger said. To make the economics work, the Intel CEO said Microsoft would need to achieve a 100-to-one reduction in the amount of data flowing between the cloud giant's data centers and PCs.",0.9142

The commitments by healthcare providers and payers follow those of 15 leading AI companies, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), OpenAI and OpenAI partner Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to develop AI models responsibly. Biden's government is pushing to set parameters around AI as it makes rapid gains in capability and popularity while regulation remains limited. ""The administration is pulling every lever it has to advance responsible AI in health-related fields,"" the White House official said, adding AI carried enormous potential to benefit patients, doctors and hospital staff, if managed responsibly. Biden issued an executive order on Oct. 30 requiring developers of AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security, the economy, public health or safety to share the results of safety tests with the government before releasing them to the public. Providers signing the commitments include Oscar, Curai, Devoted Health, Duke Health, Emory Healthcare and WellSpan Health, the White House official said in a statement. ""We must remain vigilant to realize the promise of AI for improving health outcomes,"" the official said. ""Without appropriate testing, risk mitigations and human oversight, AI-enabled tools used for clinical decisions can make errors that are costly at best - and dangerous at worst."" Absent proper oversight, diagnoses by AI can be biased by gender or race, especially when AI is not trained on data representing the population it is being used treat, the official said. 
The principles behind the administration plan call for companies to inform users whenever they receive content that is largely AI-generated and not reviewed or edited by people, and to monitor and address harms that applications might cause. Companies that sign the commitments pledge to develop AI uses responsibly, including solutions that advance health equity, expand access to care, make care affordable, coordinate care to improve outcomes, reduce clinician burnout and otherwise improve the experience of patients.",0.9938

With a market capitalization of $273.94 billion, Oracle stands as a significant player in the software industry, a fact underscored by its ambitious expansion plans. The company's P/E ratio, currently at 26.81, is trading at a low relative to its near-term earnings growth, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued given its growth prospects.

Revenue growth at the firm's cloud infrastructure unit, which competes with industry heavyweights Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, has slowed over the last three quarters. ""The lower OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) growth will worry investors as this is the main investment story,"" analysts at Barclays wrote in a note. Oracle's shares have climbed 40% this year as investors bet that the rising adoption of generative AI, the technology behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, will drive growth for companies providing data center services. The company, co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison, has been investing heavily to build data centers as part of its strategy to become a cloud-based company.  Oracle on Monday blamed supply constraints for the weak results, with CEO Safra Catz saying that demand for the company's generative AI and cloud infrastructure services was increasing at ""an astronomical rate."" Still, analysts raised concerns about the company's prospects. At least four brokerages cut their price targets on the stock following the results. ""Two consecutive quarters of cloud revenue shortfalls partially erode our confidence that a cloud transition can drive a sustainable top-line growth recovery,"" brokerage Piper Sandler said. Total cloud revenue, which includes software, rose 25% in the second quarter ended Nov. 30, missing the company's expectations for a 29%-31% increase.  
Weaker enterprise spending and intense competition from larger players were also a drag on overall results.

The two sides will also work together on the future of artificial intelligence, in a first-of-its-kind partnership on AI and the future of the workforce as business and labor grapple with the impact of the technology. Microsoft President Brad Smith told Reuters the ""neutrality agreement provides a high-level of commitment and clarity as to how we'll work with the AFL-CIO and its affiliates if we have employees or even employees of suppliers who want to pursue the formation of a union."" The AFL-CIO is the largest federation of unions in the United States made up of 60 unions representing about 12.5 million workers. AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said Microsoft's position was in stark contrast to other tech companies that aggressively fought efforts to unionize. ""Their positioning is -- if workers want to organize we shouldn't stand in their way,"" Shuler said. ""Every company basically fights us when workers want to organize."" Microsoft previously agreed to a legally-binding labor neutrality agreement when Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) employees expressed interest in joining a union as part of Microsoft's acquisition of the company.  Microsoft has a major partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and committed to pumping more than $10 billion into the startup. Surging popularity of so-called generative AI, which uses data to create new content like ChatGPT's human-sounding prose, could remake human society and make obsolete many jobs. Smith said it was important for tech companies to design AI ""with the needs of workers in mind and for workers to have a voice and provide feedback that influences the direction this technology takes."" Both the union and AFL-CIO have agreed to work jointly on public policy to ensure workers have the skills ""as the country moves into the future."" 
Shuler and Smith are holding a joint event Monday about AI and work. The goal of AI is to ""boost the productivity of workers, reduces the drudgery in jobs"" and translates those efficiency gains in higher standards of living, Smith said. Shuler said workers want a voice in how AI gets deployed ""and do I have a future pathway if indeed my job gets downgraded.""",0.9887
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/europe-agrees-landmark-ai-regulation-deal-3254100,"Dec 11, 2023","By Foo Yun Chee, Martin Coulter and Supantha Mukherjee BRUSSELS/LONDON/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Europe on Friday reached a provisional deal on landmark European Union rules governing the use of artificial intelligence including governments' use of AI in biometric surveillance and how to regulate AI systems such as ChatGPT. With the political agreement, the EU moves toward becoming the first major world power to enact laws governing AI. Friday's deal between EU countries and European Parliament members came after nearly 15 hours of negotiations that followed an almost 24-hour debate the previous day. The two sides are set to hash out details in the coming days, which could change the shape of the final legislation. ""Europe has positioned itself as a pioneer, understanding the importance of its role as a global standard setter. This is yes, I believe, a historical day,"" European Commissioner Thierry Breton told a press conference. The accord requires foundation models such as ChatGPT and general purpose AI systems (GPAI) to comply with transparency obligations before they are put on the market. These include drawing up technical documentation, complying with EU copyright law and disseminating detailed summaries about the content used for training. High-impact foundation models with systemic risk will have to conduct model evaluations, assess and mitigate systemic risks, conduct adversarial testing, report to the European Commission on serious incidents, ensure cybersecurity and report on their energy efficiency. GPAIs with systemic risk may rely on codes of practice to comply with the new regulation. Governments can only use real-time biometric surveillance in public spaces in cases of victims of certain crimes, prevention of genuine, present, or foreseeable threats, such as terrorist attacks, and searches for people suspected of the most serious crimes. The agreement bans cognitive behavioural manipulation, the untargeted scrapping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage, social scoring and biometric categorisation systems to infer political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation and race. Consumers would have the right to launch complaints and receive meaningful explanations while fines for violations would range from 7.5 million euros ($8.1 million) or 1.5% of turnover to 35 million euros or 7% of global turnover. Business group DigitalEurope criticised the rules as yet another burden for companies, on top of other recent legislation. ""We have a deal, but at what cost?

""Whilst the Parliament fought hard to limit the damage, the overall package on biometric surveillance and profiling is at best lukewarm.""  The legislation is expected to enter into force early next year once both sides formally ratify it and should apply two years after that. Governments around the world are seeking to balance the advantages of the technology, which can engage in human-like conversations, answer questions and write computer code, against the need to put guardrails in place. Europe's ambitious AI rules come as companies like OpenAI, in which Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an investor, continue to discover new uses for their technology, triggering both plaudits and concerns. Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Thursday launched a new AI model, Gemini, to rival OpenAI.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/oracles-revenue-miss-highlights-cloud-computing-hurdles-3254317,"Dec 11, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) encountered a significant setback as it reported second-quarter revenues that fell short of expectations, highlighting the tech giant's struggles in a highly competitive cloud computing market. The company's revenue of $12.94 billion missed the analysts' average estimate of $13.05 billion, reflecting broader economic pressures and intense competition. This news prompted a sharp 9% decline in Oracle's shares in extended trading, underscoring investor concerns about the company's ability to keep pace in the evolving cloud sector.
The challenging economic landscape, characterized by persistent inflation and high borrowing costs, has led many firms to tighten their spending. This trend has particularly impacted companies like Oracle, which rely heavily on enterprise spending. The slowdown in cloud spending isn't isolated to Oracle; even tech giants like Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have experienced similar challenges, as evidenced by the slowest growth in its cloud division in recent quarters. This environment raises concerns about the overall demand for cloud services.
Market Overview:
-Oracle shares plunge over 9% in extended trading following Q2 earnings miss.
-Sticky inflation and high borrowing costs dampen enterprise spending.
-Cloud competition intensifies, with Oracle struggling to gain ground against dominant players.
Key Points:
-Oracle reports Q2 revenue of $12.94 billion, below analyst estimates of $13.05 billion.
-Economic uncertainties and cloud competition weigh on demand for Oracle's offerings.
-Oracle's AI ambitions face stiff challenges from established players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
-Company narrowly beats earnings estimates with an adjusted EPS of $1.34.
Looking Ahead:
-Navigate Economic Uncertainties: Oracle must strategically address economic headwinds to mitigate their negative impact on business performance.
-Differentiate Cloud Offerings: The company needs to identify and leverage unique strengths to differentiate its cloud solutions and attract new customers.
-Capitalize on Emerging Trends: Actively investing in and capitalizing on emerging technologies like AI could offer a competitive advantage.
-Improve Operational Efficiency: Implementing cost-effective measures and streamlining operations can enhance profitability and financial stability.
-Address Competitive Pressures: Carefully analyze competitor strategies and develop effective countermeasures to maintain market position.
Despite Oracle's efforts to enhance its offerings, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI infrastructure, it faces formidable competition from established market leaders Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). These larger players have already secured substantial market shares and continue to lead in AI and cloud services, as seen in Microsoft's recent earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, propelled by growth in its AI-driven cloud segment. This market dynamic poses a significant challenge for Oracle, limiting its opportunity to carve out a substantial share in the AI ecosystem.
Oracle's second-quarter performance, while not meeting revenue expectations, did see a slight silver lining. The company reported an adjusted net income of $3.76 billion, marginally beating the Street estimates of $3.74 billion. Additionally, its adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 marginally exceeded the forecasted $1.32. However, these small victories are overshadowed by the larger narrative of Oracle's struggle to adapt and grow in a rapidly changing and competitive cloud computing landscape.

https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-needs-roadmap-for-future-competitiveness-says-charles-hoskinson-3253258,"Dec 10, 2023","LONDON - Charles Hoskinson, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry, recently highlighted the need for Bitcoin to evolve beyond its current technology to remain competitive. He pointed to the historical importance of Bitcoin but stressed that technological advancements are crucial for its continued relevance in the crypto space.
Hoskinson drew parallels between Bitcoin's current market position and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows' past dominance in the computing industry. He suggested that just as Windows had to adapt to the rise of mobile technology or risk losing its leading status, Bitcoin must also embrace change to maintain its influence within the cryptocurrency infrastructure.
As of the time of writing, Bitcoin has not exceeded its previous peak and is trading at $43,724, after attempts to breach the $44,000 mark were unsuccessful. This comes despite the digital currency achieving weekly gains of over 10%. The failure to establish a new high has sparked discussions about Bitcoin's future and its potential need for a strategic roadmap.
Hoskinson cited Cardano's implementation of smart contracts and non-interactive proof-of-work (PoW) as examples of the type of innovation that could help Bitcoin stay relevant. These developments within Cardano are seen as steps forward in making blockchain technology more accessible and efficient.
The comparison with Microsoft Windows serves as a cautionary tale; without a willingness to innovate, even the most established technologies can be overtaken as industry paradigms shift. Hoskinson's comments reflect a growing sentiment within the crypto community that Bitcoin must evolve or risk being surpassed by more technologically advanced platforms.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/uk-antitrust-regulator-considering-microsoft-openai-partnership-3252432,"Dec 08, 2023","By Muvija M, Chavi Mehta and Aditya Soni LONDON (Reuters) -Microsoft's partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI is under US and UK antitrust scrutiny, the British regulator and a media report said on Friday, following the startup's boardroom battle that led to the sudden ouster and return of CEO Sam Altman. After the dramatic episode last month, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a major OpenAI backer, was granted a non-voting, observer position at the company by a new three-member initial board. Microsoft's representative can attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information, but cannot vote on matters including electing or choosing directors. The companies have not revealed who from Microsoft will take the non-voting position and what a final OpenAI board would look like. OpenAI's parent is a non-profit company, a type of entity rarely subject to antitrust scrutiny. In 2019 it set up a for-profit subsidiary, in which Microsoft owns a 49% stake, according to a source. But a Microsoft spokesperson disputed that on Friday, saying details of its agreement were confidential, that it does not ""own any portion"" of OpenAI, and is entitled to a share of profits.  The software giant has committed to pumping more than $10 billion into the startup, allowing it to take the lead in a race for AI revenue with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google.  ""There have recently been a number of developments in the governance of OpenAI, some of which involved Microsoft,"" the UK Competition and Markets Authority said on Friday. The CMA is reviewing whether to launch a probe into Microsoft's investment to see if it could hurt UK competition. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is also examining whether the investment could have violated antitrust laws, Bloomberg News reported, adding that the inquiries were preliminary and the agency has not opened a formal investigation. The FTC declined to comment. Microsoft President Brad Smith said in statement that ""the only thing that has changed is that Microsoft will now have a non-voting observer on OpenAI's board."" ""(That) is very different from an acquisition such as Google's purchase of DeepMind in the UK,"" he added, citing the deal by its main rival in 2014. MOVE QUICKLY Other regulatory probes could follow given the growing concentration in AI, said Max von Thun, Europe director at Open Markets Institute, a non-profit organisation focused on strengthening antitrust law. ""It is essential that antitrust authorities move quickly to investigate these deals, including unwinding them if necessary, to preserve competition and prevent this critical emerging technology from being monopolized."" European Union antitrust regulators said they have been following ""very closely the situation of control.""  Britain's CMA has invited interested parties such as Google to comment on the review by Jan. 3, 2024.  The CMA will need to find evidence that the recent fall-out from the Altman affair has led to material changes in the governance of OpenAI and Microsoft's influence over its affairs, said Alex Haffner, competition lawyer and partner at Fladgate. Even if it does not pursue a full probe, the preliminary investigation will better inform the CMA's broader oversight of the fast-developing AI sector, he said. 
Microsoft has recently tangled with both the FTC and the CMA on its $69 billion acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" videogame maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) over antitrust concerns. The CMA had blocked the Activision deal earlier in the year but later changed its mind after Microsoft amended its acquisition plan.",0.97

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/uk-competition-watchdog-probes-microsoftopenai-partnership-3252835,"Dec 08, 2023","LONDON - The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has initiated an investigation into the partnership between Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI to determine whether it constitutes a merger situation under the Enterprise Act 2002, which could potentially reduce market competition in the United Kingdom. The CMA's probe, announced today, will examine the competitive implications of the tech giants' collaboration.
The inquiry is open for public participation, with stakeholders invited to submit their views by January 3, 2024. Interested parties can send their submissions to the dedicated email address provided by the CMA. The authority is particularly focused on how this partnership might impact competition within the AI technology sector, a field where sustained competition is considered crucial for driving innovation.
This development follows governance changes at OpenAI that have attracted scrutiny. The temporary dismissal and subsequent rehiring of CEO Sam Altman after a brief stint at Microsoft have raised questions about potential shifts in control that could influence market dynamics. Sorcha O’Carroll from the CMA underscored the importance of public feedback as a preliminary step in assessing whether further investigation into the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership is necessary.

The company's backlog stands robust at $23-24 billion, with expectations for Q4 contract awards to be around $2.3 billion, though some may defer to Q1 FY25.Bearish HighlightsDespite the positive outlook, the company is mindful of potential challenges. The CEO acknowledged headwinds in FY25 due to market conditions and recompete losses. Additionally, the dependence on the NASA NCAP contract, which could either double revenues or result in a $100 million annual loss, adds an element of uncertainty.Bullish HighlightsSAIC's leadership is bullish on the company's differentiated portfolio and investments in digital engineering, secure data analytics, operational AI, and Zero Trust architecture. These areas are expected to drive growth, alongside strategic pivots in their go-to-market strategy, culture, and brand.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/microsoft-and-openais-collaboration-faces-regulatory-hurdles-in-the-uk-3253066,"Dec 08, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - The United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced an investigation into the evolving partnership between Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI, the artificial intelligence company behind the renowned ChatGPT. The CMA's inquiry seeks to determine if the collaboration between these two tech entities amounts to a de facto merger, potentially leading to a formal investigation. This regulatory scrutiny comes in the wake of significant changes at OpenAI, including the temporary dismissal and reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman and the formation of a new board featuring notable figures such as Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D’Angelo.
Microsoft's substantial investment in OpenAI, totaling $13 billion for a 49% stake in its for-profit arm, has raised questions about the level of influence and control it might exert over OpenAI's operations. The CMA's concern revolves around whether recent governance changes, particularly Microsoft gaining a nonvoting observer position on OpenAI’s board, could impact competition in the AI market. This investigation could lead to significant outcomes, including a potential order for structural or behavioral changes in the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI.
Market Overview:
-CMA is seeking feedback on whether the partnership constitutes a de facto merger.
-Microsoft will have a non-voting observer position on OpenAI's board.
-An investigation could lead to structural or behavioral changes for the companies.
Key Points:
-OpenAI's recent governance changes, including the firing and reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman, prompted CMA's inquiry.
-Microsoft invested $13 billion in OpenAI's for-profit arm in 2019.
-The CMA's investigation follows similar inquiries from German and EU regulators.
-Microsoft maintains the partnership promotes AI innovation and competition.
-OpenAI emphasizes its independence and states Microsoft's board role is non-voting.
Looking Ahead:
-CMA's decision on whether to launch a formal investigation will depend on public feedback.
-Potential remedies could include separation of the companies or limitations on their collaboration.
-The investigation adds to growing global scrutiny of big tech's involvement in AI development.
Microsoft has responded to the CMA's concerns, emphasizing that its partnership with OpenAI, which began in 2019, has maintained the independence of both organizations and has been a catalyst for AI innovation and competition. Brad Smith, Microsoft Vice Chair and President, highlighted the distinction between a non-voting board observer and a full acquisition, citing Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) purchase of DeepMind as a comparative example. Microsoft has committed to cooperating with the CMA to provide necessary information.
This probe by the U.K. regulator is part of a broader international focus on the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership. The scrutiny from the CMA follows a similar examination by Germany’s Federal Cartel Office, which did not find the partnership subject to its merger-control rules but indicated a willingness to re-examine the situation should Microsoft's influence over OpenAI increase. Additionally, the European Union's antitrust watchdog has been closely monitoring the situation, especially in light of Microsoft's role in OpenAI. The CMA's actions underscore its emerging role as a key global tech regulator, particularly evident in its initial blocking and subsequent approval of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) earlier this year.

Additionally, the company's price to book value as of Q1 2024 stands at 0.55, suggesting that the stock could be undervalued relative to its assets.
Investors should note that while UNFI's revenue growth has been modest at 2.81% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024, the company is trading at a low revenue valuation multiple, as per another InvestingPro Tip. This could indicate a potential investment opportunity, especially considering that UNFI's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, providing financial stability.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/applebacked-study-finds-rise-in-data-breaches-as-iphone-maker-defends-encryption-stance-3251869,"Dec 07, 2023","By Stephen Nellis (Reuters) - In the first nine months of 2023, U.S. data breaches increased by 20% compared to the full year 2022, according to a new study that was commissioned by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The iPhone maker paid for the study, which was conducted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Stuart E. Madnick, about a year after it rolled out a new feature to expand end-to-end encryption for data stored in its iCloud service. The study, which does not include any findings of data breaches at Apple itself, argues that breaches are becoming so commonplace that the only feasible way to protect consumer data is wider use of end-to-end encryption. Such encryption makes it impossible for the company that stores the data - or anyone who might hack its servers - to unscramble a user's data without also possessing additional information, such as the passcode for one of the user's personal devices. But that encryption approach also makes it impossible for law enforcement officials to access the data without the user's knowledge and has long been a friction point between technologists and government officials. Britain is considering a law that would mandate access to private messages and has encouraged companies such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) not to expand their use of end-to-end encryption. The Apple-backed study, however, found that technology companies are frequently attacked by hackers because they provide services to valuable targets. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), for example, was hit by Chinese hackers this year, who managed to steal tens of thousands of U.S. State Department emails. 
The study said that 98% of organizations have a relationship with at least one technology vendor that experienced a data breach in the previous two years. ""In today’s interconnected world, virtually every organization relies on a wide range of vendors and software. As a result, hackers only need to exploit vulnerabilities in third-party software or a vendor’s system to gain access to the data stored by every organization that relies on that vendor,"" the study said.",0.7469
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/uk-regulators-propose-rules-for-tech-providers-to-financial-sector-3251949,"Dec 07, 2023","LONDON - The Bank of England, along with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), has proposed new draft rules aimed at managing the financial sector's growing reliance on third-party technology firms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These regulations are designed to ensure the resilience of essential services provided by critical third parties (CTPs) to the finance-related firms and infrastructures, a move that underscores the importance of operational stability in the UK's financial system.
The draft rules set forth comprehensive requirements for CTPs to evaluate and mitigate operational risks. They demand robust standards for resilience against potential disruptions, including maintaining effective incident management protocols. Additionally, CTPs will be required to manage supply chain risks diligently and provide annual self-assessments. These assessments must be accompanied by scenario testing to confirm their capacity to continue delivering crucial services during crises.
Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and CEO of the PRA, has called for measured control over these key service providers that are integral to the banking and insurance sectors. Sarah Breeden, Executive Director for Financial Stability Strategy and Risk at the Bank of England, highlighted the increasing dependency on third-party tech services by infrastructure companies. Nikhil Rathi, CEO of the FCA, pointed out that while managed outsourcing can accelerate innovation, it also introduces systemic risks.
The consultation process is open for industry feedback until March 15, 2024. The authorities expect to finalize these directives in the latter half of 2024, with an aim to bolster UK competitiveness within the global financial landscape.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/why-c3ai-ai-shares-are-plunging-today-3251965,"Dec 07, 2023","What Happened:
Shares of artificial intelligence (AI) software company C3.ai (NYSE:AI)
fell 10% in the mid-day session after the company reported second quarter with revenue falling below Wall Street's estimates. Despite the substantial growth in generative AI demand, the company identified prolonged decision cycles in many instances. Sales execution challenges in Europe were also highlighted. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to a consumption-based pricing model was acknowledged to have a short to medium-term adverse impact on revenue growth. 
As a quick recap, consumption-based contracts provide customers with enhanced flexibility. Unlike traditional long-term commitments, customers can scale their consumption of the products and features almost real-time. This means that during good times when demand is high, revenue can grow faster than if the company goes to market with a contract model. On the other hand, though, if times are tough or if competition is increasing, customers can scale down usage, and revenue will see headwinds faster than if the company goes to market with a contract model. 
Looking ahead, guidance for next quarter underwhelmed, with its revenue outlook slightly below analysts' estimates and its projected adjusted operating margin missing significantly. Additionally, the company anticipates a long-term drag on RPO (remaining performance obligations, a leading indicator of revenue) due to reduced sales prices and fewer contracts with upfront multiyear commitments stemming from the shift to a consumption model. Overall, this was a weaker quarter for the company, highlighting several challenges.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy C3.ai? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.
What is the market telling us:
C3.ai's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 73 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. 
The previous big move we wrote about was 17 days ago, when the company gained 5.9% on the shocking news that OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman is leaving the company. According to the Board, Altman's departure ""follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI."" As a result, President and co-founder Greg Brockman announced that he's quitting OpenAI.
Subsequently, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Altman and his former OpenAI co-founder, Greg Brockman, are joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team. This move signals Microsoft's commitment to leading the rapidly growing AI market. The combination of Altman and Brockman's expertise with Microsoft's vast resources could create a formidable force in the AI space. This development shows that AI platforms like C3.ai could be potential acquisition targets of larger tech and internet companies that want to quickly add AI capabilities and talent.
C3.ai is up 134% since the beginning of the year, but at $25.92 per share it is still trading 44.1% below its 52-week high of $46.37 from June 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of C3.ai's shares at the IPO in December 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $280.25.",0.9898
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/alphabet-soars-as-wall-street-cheers-arrival-of-ai-model-gemini-3251797,"Dec 07, 2023","By Aditya Soni (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares ended 5.3% higher on Thursday as Wall Street cheered the launch of Gemini, saying the new artificial intelligence model could help narrow the gap in a race with Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Long considered a leader in AI research, Alphabet lost the spotlight when OpenAI's ChatGPT swept the tech landscape upon its launch in November last year and allowed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to aggressively roll out AI-powered software to businesses. Now, Gemini looks poised to boost Alphabet's AI heft again.  The Google parent said the much-awaited AI system was faster than OpenAI's latest model and can process different forms of media such as video, audio and text. It comes in three versions, each designed to use a different amount of processing power. ""Google is beginning to address investor concerns around generative AI innovation and the high cost of running GenAI models through the combination of Gemini's different model sizes,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said. The company added over $80 billion to its market value. The warm reception contrasted with the nearly $100 billion selloff in Alphabet in February after its Bard chatbot shared inaccurate information in a promotional video and a company event failed to impress. ""Gemini's release comes at an interesting point in time when OpenAI/ChatGPT users have been complaining about how updates to the GPT model family have potentially impacted the quality of its output,"" Macquarie analysts wrote in a note. ""If Google is shipping a GPT-4-beating model, this could help gather user and developer momentum behind Google."" The company has added some of the Gemini technology to its Bard chatbot, and plans to roll out its most advanced version of Gemini through Bard early next year. A six-minute video on the model's abilities showed it could recognize sleight-of-hand magic tricks and help people create art by offering ideas based on materials and their color. MICROSOFT'S AI LEAD  Alphabet has so far trailed Microsoft in the race for AI-driven cloud revenue. In the September quarter, growth at Google Cloud slowed to a near three-year low, paling before the rebound seen at Microsoft Azure. To drive sales of its AI-based offerings, Microsoft has targeted big businesses that already use its software services, while Google has turned to startups, which analysts say have curtailed spending in an uncertain economy. Shares in both the companies have rallied around 50% this year, part of a broader AI-fueled rally in big technology stocks that has driven much of the Nasdaq's gains.  Microsoft currently trades at 30.68 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared with the Google parent's 19.59. 
""Some criticism might be that Google is late to the AI party. (But) they want to get it right and they also obviously see the huge opportunity,"" said Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management in New Jersey.  ""There's different ways to grow your company but one of the best ways is with the same customer base by giving them more solutions or more offerings and that's what I believe this (Gemini) does for Google.""",0.9827

He announced it in a post on X, without revealing anymore details of the launch. Last month, he had said that as soon as Grok was out of early beta testing, it would become available to the subscribers. As more advertisers move away from the microblogging platform, the billionaire has stressed on reducing the company's reliance on advertising and has turned his focus on subscriptions and making them more attractive. He even intends to turn X into a ""super app"", offering a range of services to its subscribers from messaging and social networking to peer-to-peer payments. Musk launched xAI in July in a response to Big Tech's AI efforts, which he has criticized for excessive censorship and a lack of adequate safety measures. 
Large tech companies including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google are racing to launch AI-powered products after OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT caught the imagination of businesses and users globally.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/disputed-landmark-ai-rules-face-crunch-eu-talks-3250224,"Dec 06, 2023","By Foo Yun Chee, Supantha Mukherjee and Martin Coulter BRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - European Union ambitions to take a lead in landmark rules for artificial intelligence hang in the balance as member states and lawmakers meet on Wednesday to try to hammer out a deal on biometric surveillance and how to regulate systems like ChatGPT. If agreed, the EU's first-of-a-kind AI Act, which was proposed by the European Commission two years ago, could serve as the benchmark for countries seeking an alternative to the United States' light-touch approach and China's interim rules. Talks between EU members and lawmakers will start at 1400 GMT and are expected to run into the early hours of Thursday, with the most likely outcome a provisional deal on principles but not crucial details, five people directly involved said. A final deal would then need to be agreed before legislation could be put in place, which could pave the way towards it becoming law before European parliamentary elections in June. But without a deal, the AI Act is likely to be shelved due to a lack of time, resulting in the 27-member bloc losing its first-mover advantage in regulating the technology. Alexandra van Huffelen, Dutch minister for digitalisation, told Reuters it was critical the EU finds a compromise, particularly on generative AI, by the end of the year. ""The world is watching us: citizens, stakeholders, NGOs and the private sector want us to agree on a meaningful piece of legislation regarding AI, including GPAI,"" she said referring to general purpose AI systems, which have a wide range of uses. DEMANDS The proposed AI rules face conflicting EU demands. The two biggest are over the use of AI in biometric surveillance and foundation models, the generative AI such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) backed OpenAI which trains on large sets of data to perform various tasks. EU lawmakers want to ban the use of AI in biometric surveillance, while governments want an exception for national security, defence and military purposes. A late proposal by France, Germany and Italy to let makers of generative AI models self-regulate added more uncertainty. 
EU ambassadors and lawmakers held separate preparatory meetings last week, but differences remain which could make it difficult to clinch a deal, said the people involved in the talks, who declined to be named because they are confidential. An official from one major EU country said whatever the meeting's outcome, there will still be a lot more work to do.",-0.5558

The company reported a 17% year-over-year increase in total revenue, amounting to $73.2 million for the quarter ending October 31, 2023. This growth is attributed to a significant rise in customer engagements and a transition to a consumption-based pricing model.

The full-year revenue guidance remains unchanged at $295 million to $320 million. However, the company anticipates a non-GAAP loss from operations to increase, ranging from negative $115 million to negative $135 million for the fiscal year. This reflects the company's strategic decision to invest heavily in generative AI, data scientists, and lead generation.Bearish HighlightsThe company reported an operating loss of $25 million for the quarter and an increased non-GAAP loss from operations guidance for the full year. Additionally, EMEA revenue decreased by 11%, and the company is facing short-term pressure on cash flow and profitability due to their investments in generative AI and human capital upgrades.Bullish HighlightsC3 AI's shift to a consumption-based pricing model has shown promising signs, with pilot conversion rates and customer engagement on the rise. The company's investments in generative AI are expected to be a significant driver of future growth, as evidenced by the launch of 29 generative AI products and a new no-code self-service application on the AWS marketplace.MissesWhile the company's revenue has increased, it did experience sales headwinds and longer decision cycles due to the implementation of AI governance functions.

InvestingPro Tips also highlight that C3 AI holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which may provide some financial resilience despite the declining trend in earnings per share. This financial cushion could be crucial as the company continues to invest in generative AI and transitions to a consumption-based pricing model. However, it's worth noting that 12 analysts have revised their earnings expectations downwards for the upcoming period, suggesting that investors should brace for potential challenges ahead.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-ftc-tries-again-to-stop-microsofts-alreadyclosed-deal-for-activision-3250445,"Dec 06, 2023","By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. antitrust enforcers argued on Wednesday that a federal judge got it wrong when she ruled that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $69 billion deal to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) was legal under competition law, in their latest attempt to stop the deal. Microsoft closed the deal on Oct. 13 after winning approval from British regulators. The deal was originally proposed in January 2022 as the biggest acquisition in the history of the gaming industry. Speaking for the Federal Trade Commission, lawyer Imad Abyad argued that the lower-court judge held the agency to too high a standard, effectively requiring it to prove that the deal was anticompetitive. He told a three-judge appeals court panel in California that the FTC had only to show that Microsoft had the ability and incentive to withhold Activision's games from rival game platforms to prove the agency's case. He said the FTC ""showed that in the past that's what Microsoft did,"" referring to allegations that Microsoft made some Zenimax games exclusive after buying that company. The FTC is fighting an uphill battle, given that it lost the lower-court fight and that the EU and Britain have signed off on the deal. The legal battle is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to fight mergers and price hikes that affect consumers in areas ranging from medicines to airline tickets. Speaking for Microsoft, lawyer Rakesh Kilaru called the FTC case ""weak"" and said that the agency had asked the lower-court judge for too much leeway. ""It is also clear that the standard can't be as low as the FTC is suggesting,"" he said. ""It can't be kind of a mere scintilla of evidence."" He argued that the agency failed to show that Microsoft had an incentive to withhold ""Call of Duty"" from rival gaming platforms. The judges actively questioned both attorneys, with Judge Daniel Collins pressing the FTC's attorney on how concessions that Microsoft gave British antitrust enforcers affect the U.S. market. He also appeared to take issue with Abyad's assertions that more analysis of the deal was necessary, especially since Microsoft had struck agreements with rivals recently, including one with  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) this past summer.  ""This was not a rush job on the part of the FTC,"" he said. Two antitrust scholars who listened to the arguments said the FTC faced a tough slog to prevail. 
A finding of ""clear error"" by a lower court judge is ""really stark,” said Alden Abbott, a former FTC general counsel, comparing it to the idea that a court ignored key evidence from a witness. Abbott said the appeals court noted that the trial judge had considered ""a huge amount of record evidence.""  The FTC filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal in December 2022, arguing that Microsoft would use Activision's popular games to suppress competition to its Xbox consoles and dominate fast-growing subscription and cloud gaming businesses. But a federal judge in California ruled in July that it failed to make its case.",-0.9031
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/explainerwhat-are-the-eus-landmark-ai-rules-3250910,"Dec 06, 2023","By Martin Coulter LONDON (Reuters) -Negotiations around the European Union's first-of-a-kind rules governing artificial intelligence (AI) looked set for a dramatic climax on Wednesday, as lawmakers enter what some hope will be the final round of discussions on the landmark legislation. What is decided could become the blueprint for other governments as countries seek to craft rules for their own AI industry. Ahead of the meeting, lawmakers and governments could not agree on key issues, including the regulation of fast-growing generative AI and its use by law enforcement. Here's what we know:   HOW DID CHATGPT DERAIL THE AI ACT? The main issue is that the first draft of the law was written in early 2021, almost two years before the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, one of the fastest-growing software applications in history. Lawmakers have scrambled to write regulations even as companies like Microsoft-based OpenAI continue to discover new uses for their technology. OpenAI's founder Sam Altman and computer scientists have also raised the alarm about the danger of creating powerful, high intelligent machines which could threaten humanity. Back in 2021, lawmakers focused on specific use-cases, regulating AI tools based on the task they had been designed to perform and categorised them by risk from minimal to high. Using AI in a number of settings – like aviation, education, and biometric surveillance – was deemed high risk, either as an extension of existing product safety laws, or because they posed a potential human rights threat. The arrival of ChatGPT in November 2022 forced lawmakers to rethink that. This so-called ""General Purpose AI System"" (GPAIS) had not been built with a single use-case in mind, but rather completes all kinds of tasks: engaging in humanlike conversation, composing sonnets, and even writing computer code. ChatGPT and other generative AI tools did not clearly fit into the act's original categories of risk, prompting an ongoing row over how they should be regulated.   WHAT ARE THE PROPOSALS? General purpose AI systems, also known as foundation models, can be built ""on top of"" by developers to create new applications. Researchers have sometimes been caught off-guard by AI's behaviour -- like ChatGPT's habit of ""hallucinating"" false answers, where the underlying model is trained to best predict strings of sentences, but sometimes produces answers that sound convincing, but are in fact false, -- and any underlying quirks buried in a foundation model's code could play out in unexpected ways when deployed in different contexts. EU proposals for regulating foundation models have included forcing companies to clearly document their system's training data and capabilities, demonstrate they have taken steps to mitigate potential risks, and undergo audits conducted by external researchers. In recent weeks, France, Germany and Italy – the EU's most influential countries - have challenged that. The three nations want makers of generative AI models to be allowed to self-regulate, instead of forcing them to comply with hard rules. They say strict regulations will limit European companies' ability to compete with dominant U.S. companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Smaller companies building tools on top of OpenAI code would also face stricter rules, while the providers like OpenAI would not. WHAT IS AT ISSUE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT? Lawmakers are also divided over the use of AI systems by law enforcement agencies for biometric identification of individuals in publicly accessible spaces, sources told Reuters. EU lawmakers want regulation to protect citizens' fundamental rights, but member states want some flexibility for the technology to be used in the interests of national security, by police or border protection agencies, for example. MEPs may drop a proposed ban on remote biometric identification, one source said, if exemptions for its use were limited and clearly-defined.   WHAT IS THE LIKELY OUTCOME? If a final text is agreed on Wednesday, the EU Parliament could theoretically vote the bill into law later this month. Even then, it could be close to two years before it comes into effect. 
Without a final agreement, however, EU lawmakers and governments may instead reach a ""provisional agreement"", with the specifics hammered out in weeks of technical meetings. That risks reigniting longstanding disagreements. They would still have to get a deal ready for a vote in spring. Without that, the law risks being shelved until after Parliamentary elections in June and the 27-member bloc would lose its first-mover advantage in regulating the technology.",0.9787
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ai-hype-continues-as-googles-gemini-model-fuels-investor-optimism-3251896,"Dec 07, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, saw a significant surge in its stock value following the release of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) model, Gemini. The introduction of Gemini has markedly alleviated apprehensions about Alphabet’s competitive stance in the rapidly evolving AI sector.
On Thursday, Alphabet (GOOG) shares experienced a substantial upswing, marking a notable intraday gain of 6.1% since July. This rally bolstered the company's market capitalization by over $80 billion. In the context of the 2023 stock market, Alphabet's shares have outperformed, showcasing a 55% increase compared to the 46% and 53% gains of the Nasdaq 100 Index and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), respectively. Microsoft, a significant player in AI due to its investment in OpenAI, is seen as a direct competitor in this space.
Market Overview:
-AI optimism has fueled 2023 gains in megacap tech stocks.
-Alphabet's cloud unit, which has been attracting business from AI startups, has seen a strong performance.
-Investors are closely monitoring any sign of weakness or strength in the AI landscape.
Key Points:
-Analysts expressed positive sentiment regarding the Gemini release, with KeyBanc Capital Markets calling it “a flex of years of AI muscle development.”
-Roth MKM expects “negative AI sentiment toward GOOGL to fade quickly leading to an uptick in its valuation multiple.”
-Google is launching three versions of Gemini for various applications:
-Gemini Ultra: The most powerful version, still being safety tested and reviewed.
-Gemini Pro: The midline version, already leveraged for some answers in Bard.
-Gemini Nano: The smallest version, intended for use on smartphones, laptops, and other
local devices.
Looking Ahead:
-The release of Gemini marks a significant step forward for Google in its quest to become a leader in the AI space.
-The model has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, and investors are clearly excited about its potential.
Analysts have positively responded to the Gemini release, with KeyBanc Capital Markets highlighting it as an indication of Alphabet’s sustained AI development efforts. Roth MKM anticipates a swift dissipation of negative AI sentiment towards Alphabet, potentially leading to an enhanced valuation multiple. The AI sector has become a critical factor in driving stock values, particularly among major technology and internet companies. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), both pivotal in AI chip production, have seen their shares surge, with Nvidia more than tripling and AMD climbing over 90% this year.
Alphabet's successful launch of Gemini, comprising its most advanced AI software model to date, has been well-received by the market. The launch of three versions of Gemini, tailored for different applications, further underscores Google's commitment to leading the global AI race.

Cherney (Reuters) -AMD estimated there was a $45 billion market for its data center artificial intelligence processors this year as it launched a new generation of AI chips on Wednesday. The total addressable market forecast is up from AMD's $30 billion estimate in June. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced two new AI data center chips from its MI300 lineup: one focused on generative AI applications, and a second chip geared toward supercomputers. The version of the processor for generative AI, the MI300X, includes advanced high-bandwidth memory that improves performance. For next year, AMD has a ""significant"" supply of AI chips that is ""well above"" $2 billion worth, CEO Lisa Su said at a press briefing. ""So there's a lot of supply that we have - let's call it reserved - and we have a lot of customers, well above the $2 billion as well,"" Su said.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ftc-doubles-down-on-challenge-to-microsofts-activision-deal-in-appeals-court-3251050,"Dec 06, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is continuing its efforts to challenge Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), even after the deal's closure and approval by British regulators. The FTC, in an appeals court, argued against the lower-court judge's ruling, which deemed the $69 billion acquisition legal under competition law. The FTC's lawyer, Imad Abyad, contended that the lower court demanded excessively stringent proof of the deal's anti-competitive nature, whereas the FTC only needed to demonstrate Microsoft's potential to restrict Activision's games from rival platforms.
Abyad referred to Microsoft's historical precedent of making some Zenimax games exclusive after acquiring the company, suggesting a similar fate for Activision's games. The FTC's challenge is an uphill battle, particularly after losing the initial court case and with the European Union and Britain already approving the deal. This legal fight is part of the Biden administration's broader strategy to curb mergers and acquisitions that could negatively impact consumer prices in various sectors.
Market Overview:
-The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) challenged a federal judge's ruling approving Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
-The agency argued the judge held them to an excessively high standard, requiring proof of anticompetitiveness rather than mere ability and incentive to harm rivals.
Key Points:
-FTC lawyer Imad Abyad argued that Microsoft's past behavior, including making Zenimax games exclusive, demonstrates potential for similar actions with Activision's titles.
-Despite losing the lower-court case and facing EU and UK approval, the FTC continues its legal fight aligned with the Biden administration's push against mergers deemed harmful to consumers.
-Microsoft lawyer Rakesh Kilaru argued the FTC case is ""weak"" and lacks sufficient evidence to prove Microsoft's incentive to withhold ""Call of Duty"" from competitors.
Looking Ahead:
-Judges actively questioned both attorneys, with concerns about the FTC's reliance on concessions made to UK regulators and Microsoft's recent agreements with rivals like  Sony  (NYSE:SONY).
-Antitrust experts predict a tough uphill battle for the FTC, likely requiring a finding of ""clear error"" on the part of the lower court judge.
The FTC initially filed a lawsuit in December 2022 to prevent the acquisition, fearing Microsoft would use Activision's games to dominate the gaming market and suppress competition for its Xbox consoles. However, a California federal judge ruled in July that the FTC failed to substantiate its claims, allowing the deal to proceed.

Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation into the country’s cloud computing industry in October, following a referral from media regulator Ofcom that highlighted Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft’s dominance of the market. In a letter published on the CMA’s website on Tuesday, Amazon said changes to Microsoft’s terms of services had made it difficult for customers to switch to alternative cloud providers, or run competitors’ services alongside.  “To use many of Microsoft’s software products with these other cloud services providers, a customer must purchase a separate license even if they already own the software,” Amazon said. “This often makes it financially unviable for a customer to choose a provider other than Microsoft.”  Last week, Reuters reported Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had submitted a similar letter to the watchdog, claiming Microsoft’s business practices had left its rivals at an unfair disadvantage.

Climate-related factors ""have become one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century"", COP28 President Sultan Ahmed Al-Jaber said in a statement.  The pledges, made as the COP28 summit on Sunday focused on climate-related health risks, included $100 million from the UAE and another $100 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Others to announce funds for climate-related health issues included Belgium, Germany and the U.S. Agency for International Development.  The World Bank launched a program to explore possible support measures for public health in developing countries, where climate-related health risks are especially high. The burden of tropical diseases will worsen as the world warms, along with other climate-driven health threats including malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. Many tropical diseases are already easy to treat. River blindness and sleeping sickness, for example, are both endemic to Africa and spread through parasitic worms and flies that are likely to proliferate in a warming world. More than 120 countries have signed a COP28 declaration acknowledging their responsibility to keep people safe amid global warming.  The declaration made no mention of fossil fuels, the main source of climate-warming emissions, which the Global Climate and Health Alliance called a ""glaring omission"".  Activists including physicians in white coats held a small demonstration on Sunday within the COP28 compound to raise awareness of the issue.  ""We are in a lot of trouble,"" said Joseph Vipond, an emergency physician from Alberta, Canada. He recalled the case of a child dying from an asthma attack made worse by smoke inhalation from Western Canada's record wildfires this year. ""This is having real world impacts.""  Climate change is also increasing the frequency of dangerous storms and more erratic rainfall.  In September Storm Daniel killed more than 11,000 people in Libya, and last year's massive flooding in Pakistan fueled a 400% increase in malaria cases across the country, according to the World Health Organization.  Earlier on Sunday, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates said scientists were working on new treatments for and prevention of mosquito-spread malaria as the rise in temperatures creates more hospitable habitat for the insects to breed.

""These new innovations give us a chance, at a reasonable cost, to make progress.""  Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also spoke on Sunday, urging reform to the world's insurance system as another key requirement to keep people safe.

The stock hit a more than one-year high and could add nearly $1 billion in value if gains hold, topping up a rise of about 37% notched for the year so far. SentinelOne's consolidated platform for enterprise customers as well as the competitive advantages of its Data Lake product are among the top factors behind its growth and rising customer base, analysts have said. Its efforts to tap growing demand for security services focused on end-user devices such as laptops and smartphones are also paying off. ""We view SentinelOne as an emerging challenger in the endpoint security space, a prominent part of the cybersecurity stack that has been dominated by larger competitors such as Microsoft and CrowdStrike,"" Morningstar analysts said in a note.  SentinelOne has also rolled out products such as the generative AI-powered Purple AI and Singularity platform to help plug vulnerabilities that come with the rising digital presence of businesses.  ""We continue to win a significant majority of competitive evaluations against both next-gen and legacy endpoint providers,"" said CEO Tomer Weingarten (NYSE:WRI). D.A.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/why-palantir-pltr-stock-is-falling-today-3249080,"Dec 04, 2023","What Happened:
Shares of data-mining and analytics company Palantir (NYSE:PLTR)
fell 8.2% in the morning session as stocks pulled back, and yields rose (leading to a bond selloff) after the S&P 500 reached a new high for the year in the final week of November 2023. Throughout 2023, major indices demonstrated robust performances, with the Nasdaq surging over 45% and the S&P 500 gaining 20% with a month remaining in the year. Investors may be asking if the market is getting ahead of itself.
The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, and the latest data showed that their efforts may be paying off. As a result, there seems to be increased optimism in the market that because inflation is stabilizing, interest rates could stabilize or even move lower. The bullish sentiment could be shifting in the other direction, even if just for a short period. As a reminder, lower rates are good for stock valuations, especially for tech companies where the market needs to discount back cash flows further out in the future. When the math is done to discount these cash flows back to today, a lower assumed discount rate leads to higher present values.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Palantir? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.
What is the market telling us:
Palantir's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 47 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. 
The previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago, when the company gained 5.1% on the news that OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman is leaving the company. According to the Board, Altman's departure ""follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI."" As a result, President and co-founder Greg Brockman announced that he's quitting OpenAI. 
Subsequently, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Altman and his former OpenAI co-founder, Greg Brockman, are joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team. This move signals Microsoft's commitment to leading the rapidly growing AI market. The combination of Altman and Brockman's expertise with Microsoft's vast resources could create a formidable force in the AI space. This development shows that AI platforms could be potential acquisition targets of larger tech and internet companies that want to quickly add AI capabilities and talent.
Palantir is up 189% since the beginning of the year, but at $18.47 per share it is still trading 13.4% below its 52-week high of $21.34 from November 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Palantir's shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,944.",0.9931

Researchers around the world are trying to perfect quantum computing, which relies on quantum mechanics to reach computing speeds far faster than classical silicon-based computers. The challenge has been to create quantum computers that are reliable enough in the real world to consistently beat conventional computers. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and China's Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) , along with startups and nation states, are all racing to develop quantum machines. As quantum researchers have made the machines big enough to outpace classical computers, they have struggled with data errors. On Monday,  IBM  showed what it says is a new way of connecting chips together inside machines and then connecting machines together which, when combined with a new error-correction code, could produce compelling quantum machines by 2033. The first machine to use them is called Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) System Two, which uses three ""Heron"" chips. Dario Gil, IBM's senior vice president and director of research, said that progress will appear fairly steady until 2029, when the full effect of the error-correction technologies come into play. After that, the machines should see a sharp uptick in capabilities, similar to how AI systems that developed slowly for the past 15 years became vastly more sophisticated over the past year. 
""You're going to have to tie them together,"" Gil said of IBM's newest chips. ""You're going to have to do many of these things together to be practical about it. Because if not, it's just a paper exercise."" IBM is not the only quantum player targeting machines within the next few years. Startup PsiQuantum, which is working with GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) to make its chips, told Reuters earlier this year it plans to have a commercial machine within six years.",0.923

This move, expected to roll out in the coming weeks, aims to bolster transparency in AI-generated content. Meta's decision to add invisible watermarking, resilient to common image manipulations like cropping and screenshots, underscores the company's commitment to ensuring the authenticity and proper use of AI-produced imagery.
The company, which has been at the forefront of integrating AI into consumer products, introduced various AI-infused offerings in September, such as bots capable of creating photo-realistic images and smart glasses with interactive capabilities. Meta's blog post emphasized its plans to extend the invisible watermarking feature to many of its products that generate AI images in the future. This initiative reflects the growing importance of AI in the tech industry, as evidenced by the success of Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has prompted companies to explore the expansive capabilities of large language models.
Market Overview:
-Meta Platforms announced plans to add invisible watermarks to its AI-powered image generation tool Imagine, increasing transparency and accountability.
-This move follows the company's recent rollout of various AI-driven products, including chatbots and smart glasses, in September.
-Meta aims to expand the watermarking technology to other products featuring AI-generated images, promoting responsible use of the technology.
Key Points:
-The watermarks are designed to be resilient to common image alterations, enhancing their effectiveness in identifying AI-generated content.
-This initiative aligns with the growing trend of tech companies embracing AI for innovative products, following the success of Microsoft-backed ChatGPT.
-Meta leverages its custom AI model, Meta AI, built upon the powerful Llama 2, to offer AI-powered experiences across its platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp.
-The company is actively exploring new applications for generative AI, testing over 20 different ways to improve user experiences.
Looking Aheady
-Meta's commitment to watermarking AI-generated content sets a precedent for responsible development and deployment of this technology.
-This move is expected to foster trust and transparency among users, potentially mitigating concerns around misinformation and copyright infringement.
-The company's expansion of Imagine's accessibility and search capabilities demonstrate its continued investment in AI innovation and user experience enhancement.
The Menlo Park-based company's move into advanced AI applications and watermarking for image integrity signifies a significant step in the evolution of digital content creation and management. This initiative not only aims to safeguard the authenticity of AI-generated content but also positions Meta as a leader in responsible AI utilization.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/google-calls-for-uk-antitrust-action-against-microsoft-in-cloud-computing-3248038,"Dec 01, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG) has recently urged the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud computing practices, alleging anti-competitive behavior that stifles the market. This request emerges amid broader scrutiny of the cloud computing industry dominated by Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in various global regions, including the UK, European Union, and the United States. Google's push for regulatory intervention was detailed in a letter to the CMA, which Reuters obtained.
The letter highlights Google's concerns about Microsoft's licensing practices, which they claim unfairly limit competition and customer choice in the UK's cloud computing sector. According to Google, Microsoft's practices effectively compel customers to rely on Azure, Microsoft's cloud service, even if they prefer the offerings of competitors like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud. This situation, Google argues, directly harms customers and represents a significant obstacle to market competition. In response to these allegations, the CMA has remained silent, choosing not to comment publicly.
While Microsoft has attempted to address these concerns by updating its licensing rules to promote competition, rivals, including Google, have found these changes insufficient. A Microsoft spokesperson defended the company's efforts, noting that over 100 independent cloud providers have embraced their revised policies and that competition in the cloud hyperscaler market remains robust. Despite these claims, Google Cloud Vice President Amit Zavery criticizes Microsoft's approach, advocating for a multi-cloud strategy that allows customers greater freedom to move between different cloud services according to their needs.
The core of the dispute centers around Microsoft's policy updates related to using their software licenses, like Windows, in the cloud. These updates have seemingly made it more expensive for customers to use Google (GOOGL) or AWS instead of Azure. Google argues that while AWS, the market leader, doesn't impose similar constraints, Microsoft's licensing restrictions prevent fair competition. Google's recommendations to the CMA include enforcing Microsoft to enhance interoperability for customers using Azure alongside other services and prohibiting Microsoft from withholding security updates from clients switching to other providers.

OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman earlier this month was removed as CEO by the company’s board of directors, but was swiftly reinstated after a weekend of outcry from employees and shareholders.  Reuters last week exclusively reported that the ouster came shortly after researchers had contacted the board, warning of a dangerous discovery they feared could have unintended consequences.  The internal project named Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup's search for what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one source told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks. However, Microsoft President Brad Smith, speaking to reporters in Britain on Thursday, rejected claims of a dangerous breakthrough. ""There's absolutely no probability that you're going to see this so-called AGI, where computers are more powerful than people, in the next 12 months. It's going to take years, if not many decades, but I still think the time to focus on safety is now,"" he said.  Sources told Reuters that the warning to OpenAI's board was one factor among a longer list of grievances that led to Altman's firing, as well as concerns over commercializing advances before assessing their risks.  
Asked if such a discovery contributed to Altman's removal, Smith said: ""I don't think that is the case at all. I think there obviously was a divergence between the board and others, but it wasn't fundamentally about a concern like that.  “What we really need are safety brakes.

The observer position means Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s representative can attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information, but it does not have voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who had recruited Altman to Microsoft after his ouster from OpenAI, had said earlier that governance at the ChatGPT maker needs to change. OpenAI said last week announced a new initial board that consists of former Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) co-CEO Bret Taylor as chair and Larry Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary. Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, who was part of the board who fired Altman, also stayed on for the new one.  The new OpenAI board is on an active search for six new members with expertise in fields from technology to safety and policy. OpenAI investors are unlikely to get a seat on the non-profit board, sources told Reuters. Microsoft has committed to invest over $10 billion into OpenAI and owns 49% of the company. It did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mira Murati, who had been OpenAI's chief technology officer and was briefly named interim CEO after Altman's ouster, is once again the company's CTO. OpenAI ousted Altman on Nov. 17 without any detailed cause, setting off alarm bells among investors and employees. He was reinstated four days later with the promise of a new board. Altman's exit sparked confusion about the future of the startup at the center of an artificial intelligence boom. His co-founder Greg Brockman, who had followed Altman out of the company, would return as president, Altman said on Wednesday. ""Greg and I are partners in running this company. We have never quite figured out how to communicate that on the org chart, but we will,"" Altman said.  OpenAI's chief scientist Ilya Sutskever will no longer be part of the board, Altman said.  Sutskever had joined in the effort to fire Altman but later signed an employee letter demanding his return, expressing regret for his ""participation in the board's actions."" 
""I love and respect Ilya, I think he's a guiding light of the field and a gem of a human being. I harbor zero ill will towards him,"" Altman said, adding the company was discussing how Sutskever could continue his work at OpenAI. Apart from Altman, Brockman, Sutskever, D'Angelo, OpenAI's previous board consisted of entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology.",0.7876

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/microsoft-earnings-revenue-beat-in-q4-1927964,"Jul 18, 2019","Investing.com - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported a 21% increase in fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings  that easily beat analysts' expectations on Thursday and a 12% gain in revenue.
Shares moved higher in response.
The software giant reported adjusted earnings of $1.37 a share on revenue of $33.72 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected earnings $1.21 on revenue of $32.75 billion. That compared to earnings of $1.13 on revenue of $30.09 billion a year ago. The company had reported earnings of $1.14 on revenue of $30.57 billion in the fiscal-third quarter. GAAP earnings were $1.71 thanks to a tax benefit.
The earnings beat came despite slowing growth for its Azure cloud business, a key business driver. The company said the Azure business growth was 64% in the quarter, down from a growth rate of 73% in the fiscal-third quarter. Still, the Azure business is, by far, Microsoft's fastest growing business. 
Its commercial cloud business rose 39% to $11 billion in the quarter, about a third of total revenue.
Company officials said in the conference call that the cloud business will continue to be strong in the first quarter and beyond. Microsoft expects revenue growth above 10% in fiscal 2020.
Microsoft shares gained 1.6% to trade at $138.50 in after-hours trade following the report. The shares had risen slightly during regular trading.
For the year, Microsoft said revenue rose 14% to $125.8 billion. Earnings rose to an adjusted $4.75 a share from $3.88 a year ago.
For the quarter, Microsoft's three business segments -- Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing -- saw revenue and operating profit gain for the quarter and the fiscal year.
More Personal Computing was the weakest link, with quarterly revenue up just 4% and 8% for the year, held back by weakest in its gaming business. Xbox and software and device sales fell 3%.
But revenue from its Surface family of notebook computers and tablets rose 14%.

https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/former-cardinals-exec-pleads-guilty-to-hacking-into-astros-39;-network-379337,"Jan 08, 2016","Investing.com -- The former director of baseball development for the St. Louis Cardinals pleaded guilty on Friday to computer hacking charges in connection with securing unauthorized access of computer information owned by the Houston Astros, their former National League Central rivals.
Christopher Correa, 35, made the guilty pleas on five counts of unauthorized access of a protected computer during an appearance on Friday in Houston federal court. No other members of the Cardinals' organization have been charged in the case.
Much like most of their Major League Baseball counterparts, the Astros and Cardinals conduct their own self scouting by analyzing their team's performance during a live game. In order to ameliorate the process, the Astros operate an online database known as Ground Control, which includes scouting reports, statistics and contract information on its 40-man Major League roster, as well as its vast farm system. As part of Correa's plea agreement, he admitted to illegally accessing the Astros' Ground Control database and e-mail accounts of a number of team employees.
Correa, who spent seven years in the Cardinals' organization from 2009 through last July, admitted to illegally accessing the information for a period lasting roughly a year through March, 2014.
""We have secured an appropriate conviction in this case as a result of a very detailed, thorough and complete investigation,"" U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson said in a statement. ""Unauthorized computer intrusion is not to be taken lightly. Whether it’s preserving the sanctity of America’s pastime or protecting trade secrets, those that unlawfully gain proprietary information by accessing computers without authorization must be held accountable for their illegal actions.""
In one case, Correa allegedly obtained an Astros' employee's password because the staffer was formerly employed by the Cardinals. When the former Cardinals' employee left the position, he turned in a Cardinals-owned laptop, along with the password he used for the computer. Using the information, Correa was able to gain access to the Astros' Ground Control database and the employee's email account with his new team.
The password provided Correa with entry to a trove of confidential, proprietary information compiled by the Astros' scouting department. On March 24, 2013, Correa accessed an Astros' employee's Ground Control account for an hour and 43 minutes, court records show. While there, he downloaded a Microsoft (O:MSFT) Excel file which included a weekly digest page that contained information on the performance and injuries of prospects scouted by the franchise. Weeks later, Correa gained unauthorized access of the Astros' network on June 8, the final day of the 2013 MLB Amateur Draft. At that point, Correa retrieved information on an unnamed player the Astros drafted later in the Draft, along with three players the Cardinals selected a day earlier, according to court filings.
Correa also hacked into the system on July 31, 2013, shortly before the MLB trade deadline. In the frenzied final hours before the deadline expired, Correa allegedly viewed detailed notes of trade discussions the Astros conducted with other teams.
Although the Cardinals did not immediately comment on Correa's activities, Major League Baseball said in a statement that it ""will determine what further actions to take after receiving all the relevant information"" from authorities.
Correa faces a maximum possible sentence of five years in federal prison and a possible $250,000 fine for each conviction.",0.9042

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusivegoogle-pushes-for-antitrust-action-against-microsoft-in-uk-cloud-market-3247309,"Nov 30, 2023","By Martin Coulter LONDON (Reuters) -Google has called on Britain’s antitrust regulator to take action against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), claiming its business practices had left rivals at a significant disadvantage, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Microsoft and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have faced mounting scrutiny around the world over their dominance of the cloud computing industry, with regulators in Britain, the European Union, and the U.S. probing their market power. The CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) launched an investigation into Britain’s cloud computing industry in October, following a referral from media regulator Ofcom which highlighted Amazon and Microsoft’s dominance of the market. In 2022, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's Azure had a combined 70-80% share of Britain's public cloud infrastructure services market, Ofcom said. Google’s cloud division was their closest competitor, at around 5-10%. In a letter submitted to the CMA, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said Microsoft’s licensing practices unfairly discouraged customers from using competitor services, even as a secondary provider alongside Azure. “With Microsoft’s licensing restrictions in particular, UK customers are left with no economically reasonable alternative but to use Azure as their cloud services provider, even if they prefer the prices, quality, security, innovations, and features of rivals,” Google said in its letter to the CMA. Such practices directly harmed customers, and were the only significant barrier to competition in Britain’s cloud computing market, the company said. The CMA declined to comment. TACKLING CONCERNS  Microsoft last year updated its licensing rules to address such concerns and promote competition, though the changes did not satisfy rivals.  A Microsoft spokesperson said the company had worked with independent cloud providers to address concerns and provide opportunity and that more than 100 worldwide had taken advantage of the changes. ""As the latest independent data shows, competition between cloud hyperscalers remains healthy. In the second quarter of 2023 Microsoft and Google made equally small gains on AWS, which continues to remain the global market leader by a significant margin,"" the Microsoft spokesperson said. Speaking to Reuters, Google Cloud Vice President Amit Zavery criticised Microsoft’s practices, and said his company was committed to a multi-cloud approach, in which customers could easily move between providers depending on their needs. ""A lot of our software and cloud services interoperate, and can run on AWS or on Azure as well, so you're not restricted,"" he said. ""If you don't fix this, eventually you will have fewer cloud providers, and then innovation will not really happen, and investments will start shrinking."" At issue was Microsoft's decision to update the terms for when customers wanted to use their Windows or other software licenses in the cloud, effectively resulting in higher costs if they used Google or AWS instead of Microsoft's Azure. Asked why Amazon, which boasts a larger share of the cloud market than Microsoft, did not pose a similarly anticompetitive risk, Zavery said AWS consumers were not facing the same restrictions. “There are some issues, in terms of cloud interoperability, but we can fix that. That's a discussion between providers, which is much understood, and customers are forcing that conversation,” he said. 
“The problem we run into with Microsoft is that there's no technical issue, but you have licensing restrictions which means we are now being prevented from competing.”   Google made six recommendations to the CMA, including forcing Microsoft to improve interoperability for customers using Azure and alongside other cloud services, and banning it from withholding security updates from those that switch.",0.9822

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-domos-consumptionbased-model-drives-growth-company-to-refinance-debt-3247813,"Dec 01, 2023","Business intelligence software company, Domo (NASDAQ:DOMO), Inc., reported Q3 FY 2024 earnings, exceeding expectations with key top-line metrics. The company's shift towards a consumption-based pricing model and the introduction of a freemium model have been instrumental in driving user growth and adoption of premium features. Domo also announced plans to refinance and extend the maturity of its outstanding debt.
Key takeaways from the call:Domo achieved its highest operating income of $5 million and an operating margin of 6%.Over 20% of Domo's Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is now on the consumption model, with plans to shift the majority of revenue to this model by the end of next year.The company has launched a freemium model, which has resulted in customers signing up for paid deals within a short sales cycle.Domo has made architectural changes to allow customers to keep data and associated querying and processing with partners like Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), AWS, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).The company reported Q3 billings of $74.8 million, a 1% YoY increase, and total revenue of $79.7 million, also a 1% YoY increase. Subscription revenue accounted for 89% of total revenue and grew 3% YoY.Domo expects a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.05 to $0.09 for Q4, and $0.24 to $0.28 for the full year.The company is in the process of refinancing its debt to reduce interest rates and extend maturity.Domo's consumption model, which allows customers to pay based on usage rather than a fixed seat-based model, has seen success, winning new customers and upselling existing ones. The company reported examples of a Canadian retailer that switched to Domo to consolidate data, a healthcare software company that tripled its contract size after adopting Domo's consumption model, and an educational software company that chose Domo for its ETL needs and embedded analytics.
The company's freemium model, Domo Everywhere, provides data to partners' customers and turns data provision into a profit center. The company is confident that this model will continue to drive adoption and revenue growth.
Domo also reported cost optimization measures, including a reduction of its workforce by about 7%. The company aims to achieve positive operating cash flow for FY '24 and free cash flow positive for FY '25. Domo (NASDAQ: DOMO) has engaged an investment bank to help with refinancing and extending the maturity of its outstanding debt, with significant interest from potential lenders.
The company resolved several at-risk enterprise accounts and expects a recovery in the next three to four quarters. Domo believes it is making the right moves for long-term growth and feels better positioned with its customers. The shift to consumption has been positive, allowing the company to upsell and save accounts. The architectural change allows Domo to keep computing charges and credits when partnering with other companies.InvestingPro InsightsDomo, Inc.'s latest earnings report has demonstrated a strategic pivot that's garnering attention, with their shift to a consumption-based pricing model and the launch of a freemium service. In light of these developments, let's delve into some key metrics and tips from InvestingPro that could provide a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.
InvestingPro Data shows Domo's market capitalization stands at $342.43M, reflecting the market's current valuation of the company. Despite an impressive gross profit margin of 76.47% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, the company's P/E ratio is -4.39, indicating that investors are expecting negative earnings. This aligns with the company's current trajectory, as it is not anticipated to be profitable this year. Additionally, the revenue growth has been reported at 11.47% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, which, while positive, shows a deceleration when compared to previous periods.
An InvestingPro Tip that stands out is the concern over Domo's ability to meet short-term obligations, as its liquid assets fall short of its immediate liabilities. This could be a crucial factor for investors to consider, especially in the context of the company's plans to refinance its debt. Moreover, with two analysts revising their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, there is a notable caution in the market sentiment surrounding Domo's future performance.
For readers interested in a more comprehensive analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, which can shed light on aspects such as stock price volatility, the increase in total debt over consecutive years, and a strong return over the last month. Domo's strategic moves and the market's response highlight the importance of staying informed with real-time data and expert insights.

Today's call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Lowry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Peter Lowry: Good afternoon, and welcome. On the call today, we have Josh James, our Founder and CEO, and David Jolley, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll lead off with our safe harbor statement and then on to the call. Our press release was issued after the market close and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, where this call is also being webcast. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements related to our business under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. These include, but are not limited to, statements about future and prospects or financial projections and cash position; statements regarding the potential of our consumption-based pricing; statements about our sales team and technology, our expectations for new business opportunities, transactions and initiatives; statements regarding our channel of communications and upcoming events; statements regarding the potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on our business; and statements regarding the impact of macroeconomic and other conditions on our business. For discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to documents we file with the SEC, in particular, today's press release, our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q. These documents contain and identify important risk factors and other information that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Domo's performance. Other than revenue, unless otherwise stated, we will be discussing our results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from our GAAP results. Please refer to the tables in our earnings press release for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure, which we have posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at domoinvestors.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Josh. Josh?
Josh James: Thank you, Pete, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. In Q3, we were able to exceed guidance for our key top-line metrics, including revenue, subscription revenue, and billings. A highlight in the quarter is that we had our highest operating income in history of $5 million, and our highest operating margin in history of 6%. Over the past few years, and especially the last few quarters, we have been incubating critical pivots that are finally coming together. They are clear and powerful priorities that are removing friction and strengthening our ability to deliver unmatched value to the market. Specifically, several years ago, we decided to test an idea: ""What would customers do if they had unlimited access to features for an unlimited number of users and all visualization for free?"" It was a simple value prop to customers. Pay for the value you are realizing. Well, after positive feedback we decided to run an even broader pilot last year, and the pilot proved to be a smash hit. We now feel like we've reached critical mass with over 20% of our ARR on the consumption model. As we continue to look at the results from this very large sample size, we feel very confident in making the decision and saying we're going all in on consumption. By the end of next year, we expect to have the vast majority of our revenue on the consumption model. Again, we now have over 400 customers on consumption contracts, representing over 15% of our customer base and over 20% of our ARR. When customers move to consumption, we are seeing user counts growing at almost 3 times the speed of seat-based customers. And we are seeing 3 times the adoption rate on premium features like data science. We've also rolled out reporting so our customers can see in real time what their consumption patterns are. So far, even with the highest usage our customers are seeing, the feedback has been incredibly positive because customers recognize the value of that usage. As an example, it took us eight years at a fast food chain to get an ARR of about $200,000. Now that they've converted to consumption, this company has committed to an ARR of over $550,000 over the next three years by expanding the use of Domo across the organization. One fun story to relate that has happened to me on multiple occasions over the last few months is watching how our customers react to the new model. I've seen the epiphanies go off in their eyes as they recognize and then look at people internally in the room and tell them conclusively that because they now have unlimited users, they can start looking at sunsetting all of their other BI technologies and legacy reporting tools and use Domo instead. Well, I couldn't have said it better myself. In support of our consumption strategy and to pave a completely open path to adoption, we've also launched a new freemium model. Freemium was impossible before our consumption model and gives everyone a risk-free opportunity to get in and try Domo with no obligations and no restrictions. Domo customers have access to all the Domo features with unlimited users and they can tackle any use case they want. And when they want to go bigger, they can click from within Domo to buy consumption credits and have an unlimited highway to multiply their impact on their business. This approach seamlessly aligns with our core philosophy of delivering value before requiring payment, reinforcing our commitment to providing accessible and valuable solutions to our users. We rolled out our free offering last month and will be rapidly iterating on it over the next quarter to focus on user experience and easy onboarding. We think that long term, this alters our ability to attract new customers and give them a friction-free path to move through the pipeline from free to paid usage to sharing with more users to broad use case adoption. Of course, this naturally leads to expanding credits and being ready for a long-term relationship with our sales and support organization. This new flow evolves us from having to work with cold leads to being able to talk with happy customers who already see the value of the platform and are ready to lean in more. To demonstrate the power of having a freemium model, let me share a story from two weeks ago. Our sales team had been calling a CTO prospect for over a year with no luck. One of our salespeople called the CTO on a Friday afternoon and left a message about freemium and the free credits it comes with. The CTO proceeded to sign up for a free instance, and over the weekend, multiple users connected to disparate data sources and built data flows powering over 40 reports. By Monday, the CTO was in love with the product and signed up for a three-year deal with a total contract value well into the six figures. And that was a three-day sales cycle. Our freemium product also completely changes the conversation with potential partners who have wanted to leverage our Domo Everywhere product to deliver data experiences through Domo for their own customers. In the past, if we had a customer with, say, 20,000 external end users, it would have required a major upfront investment, which often led our customer to reduce the use case to maybe just the top 5% of external customers. With freemium, however, we can give all 20,000 of those users a free instance of Domo immediately at no cost. This creates a very meaningful introduction to Domo for those end users with an obvious upgrade experience because they can experience the value and immediately expand and put more of their own data in our platform. In a consumption world, focusing on adoption through product-led growth and support programs is the critical path to success for both customers and for Domo. Increased adoption leads to happier and more successful customers, and the corollary is, of course, increased revenue. As we roll out features and training that support adoption, we've seen our customers rapidly expand their usage of our platform compared to when they were under seat-based pricing. For example, one of our largest customers had been a customer for six years. In those first six years, they had grown to 3,500 active users and 17 departments. Then, they converted to our consumption model. The growth was rapid. In just one additional year, they added 2,300 more active users and more than doubled the number of departments and use cases. This has dramatically increased the return for the customer and, of course, has strengthened our relationship in the account. In support of our shift to the consumption model, focusing on our customers' adoption of our platform brings complete alignment between us and our customers around multiplying value. It's all about opening up unlimited use cases to address a completely expanding list of customer needs. And it helps us learn more about what drives customer success. For example, which product features and functionality in our products really drive expanded usage? What of our support behaviors drive additional adoption of our products? It shifts the dynamic from trying to sell the customer more products to helping them find more ways to receive value. Now, the progress we've made with our consumption model and with our launch of freemium has dramatically altered our ability to be successful within the ecosystem and our partners. Only recently, we've changed our architecture to allow Domo to drive consumption for partners like Snowflake, AWS, and Microsoft. Before now, we've had conflict in the channel, where we sometimes drove consumption or compute away from our vendors. With the architecture changes, we now allow customers to choose to keep the data and the associated querying and processing of data with our partners. It was a substantial investment on our part, but we are very excited that this has all been reconciled. Because of these changes, we'll be making some announcements soon, describing partnerships where customers are able to retire spend by purchasing Domo through various app stores and marketplaces from major tech players. As it relates to AI, this is another area where consumption allows our customers to get in and start seeing the value of AI in their business without an upfront commitment or investment. As mentioned earlier, we've seen dramatically higher uptake in our data science offerings among our consumption customers compared to our seat-based customers, and we expect to see similar levels of adoption as we continue to expand our AI service layer and other AI offerings. The consumption model will expose many more customers to AI because they don't have to sign a contract before they start using it. This in turn, of course, drives consumption. We have several AI-related product launches lined up for the coming months that will help our customers build reports and interact with their data in a ChatGPT-like fashion. Now, to illustrate the impact of this new model that has already penetrated over 20% of our ARR, please let me share some real-life examples from some of our customers. So first, a significant new logo win with a Canadian retailer that was using competing BI solutions was having issues with silo data and with connecting to data in disparate systems. The company chose Domo for our consumption model, which made it easy for them to sunset legacy seat-based tools when they weren't sure they were getting the value that they needed. We are starting to see more and more of these cases, and it's certainly good to be the consolidator. A healthcare software company was using our Domo Everywhere solution to provide data to their medical customers. The company was adding new Domo Everywhere customers at a faster rate than expected and it was challenging under a seat-based model where they had to commit to their investment before receiving the value. Since transferring over to consumption now, our customer has tripled their contract size with us, and yes, that math works. An educational software company was debating which vendor to use for their ETL needs. They entered into an upsell contract with Domo, not only because of our ETL features, but because our consumption contract structure allowed them to predict their cost with a high level of confidence. Additionally, the company had been considering using Domo Everywhere to provide embedded analytics to thousands of their end users. Moving to a consumption model, opened the door for them to test out our Domo Everywhere experience in a very cost-effective manner. And then, because of the value they've seen in the Domo platform, this customer has committed to dramatically alter the scale of their investment and agreed to a two-year six-figure ARR contract in Q3 with a significant upsell built into the second year. Is consumption driving adoption? It certainly looks like it. Another example is a financial services company that purchased Domo to consolidate data from multiple loan origination systems. The consumption model was key to their decision to go with Domo because it unlocked our data science and sandbox features, which were critical to their use case and would have been outside their budget under our seat-based model. Does access to all of Domo help customers unlock the value of the entire platform and become more committed to the entirety of our platform? I think so. A digital customer engagement platform company has been a Domo customer for a decade. The initial use case was for sales and marketing analytics. However, about a year ago, the company was considering a cancellation because they felt like they were paying too much per seat for about 350 users. What saved the account was a move to consumption with unlimited users. Using our product, they created an app, and because they have unlimited users, they were able to deploy the app company-wide, and now have over a thousand users on Domo's platform. Not only did we save an account that was going to cancel, several months after they converted to consumption, they actually committed to an increased level of consumption and upped their spend with us. Now, would we have been able to save this customer without consumption? No. And now we have an upsell. Looking outside of Q3, here's a few more examples of how consumption is changing the game for us. A healthcare analytics company, which is using several of our larger competitors, is looking to replace some business objects and other legacy providers. Consumption is allowing the company to replace the other vendors and expand Domo without the friction of a new contract discussion. Can Domo benefit from vendor consolidation? Yes, we can. Another small highlight is a digital asset company that was about to cancel because they thought we were too expensive for the number of users they had in the account on seat-based pricing. They moved to a consumption contract with unlimited users. Additionally, they agreed to triple their contract size, and then, just last week, agreed to triple it again. So, they are now close to 10x their original size, as opposed to just recently being on the brink of canceling. Do I wish that all my customers were on consumption contracts? Yes, I do. Lastly, an insurance company that was paying us $200,000 a year moved to consumption because our seat-based model didn't allow them to expand as rapidly as they wanted to. With the initial move to consumption, they increased their contract with us by over $100,000. 15 months later, after they had been able to fully realize the value Domo can provide due to having unlimited users and functionality, they added another $200,000 annually to their contract to replace their spend with Cognos. So, in totality, I think these are some great examples of multiple customers that highlight the progress we are making as a company. Now, while we are marching toward improving the prospects of the company, we are also optimizing our costs so we can operate as efficiently as possible. To that end, we've made changes that impacts approximately 7% of our workforce, as well as reductions in contractors, marketing programs, and other expenses. We are cognizant of the effect this has on people and would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to everyone for their contributions. Now, as we look to the future, I'm sure you can feel my energy around these pivots we're making and the signals we're seeing from customers and partners that resoundingly convince us that they're the right moves. Even when we were growing 30% quarter-over-quarter -- year-over-year, I wasn't this optimistic about our future and our stability as I am now. We're quickly migrating to the consumption model. In Q4, we'll have the vast majority of our new logo customers on consumption and we will continue to encourage our existing customers to switch to consumption, resulting in the vast majority of our ARR transition to the consumption model within the next year. Freemium, our adoption programs, and our AI investments will continue to bolster our efforts in moving to consumption where customers are able to experience value and see the vision of what Domo can mean to their company before having to pay and commit to everything. All of these changes will also lead to a dramatic shift in our approach and success with partners and the broader ecosystem over the next 12 months, which should meaningfully impact our ability to generate leads efficiently. Domo is becoming a much more interesting company with prospects that excite our broader team. And with that, I'll now turn it over to David.
David Jolley: Thanks, Josh. I love those examples. Like you, I'm excited about our key areas of focus and believe we're really well positioned to execute on the opportunities in front of us. Now, while we aspire to higher growth rates than we're currently experiencing, I'm pleased that we were able to exceed the billings guidance that we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We delivered Q3 billings of $74.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 1%. Total revenue was $79.7 million, also a year-over-year increase of 1%. Subscription revenue represented 89% of our total revenue and grew... [Technical Difficulty]

Operator: You are live. Please go ahead.
David Jolley: All right, very good. Sorry for the short delay. But thanks, Josh. I appreciate that and appreciate those great examples. Like you, I'm excited about our key areas of focus and believe we're well positioned to execute on the opportunities in front of us. Now, while we aspire to higher growth rates than we're currently experiencing, I'm pleased that we were able to exceed the billings guidance that we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We delivered Q3 billings of $74.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 1%. Total revenue was $79.7 million, also a year-over-year increase of 1%. Subscription revenue represented 89% of our total revenue and grew 3% year-over-year. And our ARR grew roughly in-line with subscription revenue growth. In reviewing the metrics that will impact the remainder of the year, our current RPO was $230.8 million, consistent with last year. And our total RPO grew 4% to $367.2 million as of October 31. On a dollar-weighted measure, we continue to have approximately two-thirds of our customers in our multi-year contracts. Our gross retention was above 85%, and net retention was about 95%. Last quarter, we identified potential renewal challenges with several large customers. And while we and some of our customers continue to face challenging IT spending environment, in Q3, these renewals discussions played out somewhat better than expected, which did help our results. In regards to the large renewal risks that we had identified last quarter, we have saved a few of them and have not identified any beyond those that we had identified in last quarter for the fourth quarter. Moving on to margins and profitability. Our subscription gross margin was 84.8%, up 0.2 percentage points from Q3 of last year. And non-GAAP operating margin was a record high 6.3%, up 5.4 percentage points from a year ago. Our net loss was very close to breakeven at $24,000, which is our best result to date, and a big improvement from a net loss of $4.4 million a year ago. Net loss per share was $0, based on 36.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. In Q3, cash used in operations was approximately $4.3 million. We capitalized approximately $2 million of software costs, resulting in a decline of our cash balance of $6.5 million from last quarter to $57.4 million. Cash flow from operations in Q3 was negatively impacted by the timing of collections on some receivables. However, we're still on track to generate positive operating cash flow for FY '24, and therefore, expect our Q4 cash flow from operations to be in the range of $3 million to $4 million. Looking forward to next year, we're committed to not only being operating cash flow positive, but we are targeting free cash flow positive for FY '25. In order to bring our cost structure in alignment with this target, we recently reduced our headcount-related expense by approximately 7% and also optimize a handful of other costs. For Q4 top-line metrics, we're guiding to a billing range of $102 million to $103 million, and expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $79 million to $80 million. For the full year of fiscal '24, we expect billings to be in the range of $317.7 million to $318.7 million, and we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $317.8 million to $318.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 3%. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, of $0.05 to $0.09 for Q4. This assumes a 36.8 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, of $0.24 to $0.28. This assumes 36.1 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. Additionally of note is the fact that we've engaged an investment bank to assist us with refinancing and extending the maturity of our outstanding debt. And at this point in the process, we have a significant level of interest from potential lenders. In conclusion, we posted better-than-expected top-line results with record profitability and believe we're making the right moves to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Eric Martinuzzi: Yeah, congrats on the good numbers for the quarter, and I appreciate the examples regarding the capacity-based pricing impacts. I wanted to understand a little bit more on the risk of non-renewals. I think last quarter, you talked about four or five enterprise accounts that were in danger and that was part of the reset to the outlook for FY '24. Can you give us a little better color? Have we reached resolution on those four or five at-risk enterprise accounts?
Josh James: Yes, we've reached resolution. Good news, we were actually able to keep a couple of them just with down sales, but we still kept them as customers. So that was a little bit of a bright spot when it came to the bad news. And this quarter, we've -- given the guidance, we're obviously not -- we're not on a toward pace here, but we, at the same time, feel pretty good about looking out over the next three, four quarters in terms of the pacing of where customers are that are at risk. It feels like we hit the bottom of that, and we're recovering from that. And like we mentioned, many of the examples with the consumption pricing, we actually end up on the consolidation, being the consolidator side of the equation versus having just being impacted by others. So, the move to consumption definitely changed the relationship with a lot of our customers and has helped us save a bunch of accounts. And we think especially as that plays out over the future, like we talked about, there's so many upsells that we're getting from these accounts. If you look at the cohort of customers that have been through renewal, we haven't lost any customers that have signed up to consumption. And it's a smaller sample size, 30 to 40, but as that number gets bigger, we'll keep watching that. But it certainly is extremely encouraging looking at the 20% of our business that's purely consumption and knowing that we can get that number to a vast majority just over the next 12 months.
Eric Martinuzzi: Okay. The other comment that you made last quarter was regarding the pipeline. And you characterized the pipeline back then as soft in all stages. I'm wondering if you could update that view on the pipeline.
Josh James: Yeah, it feels -- as we look at the numbers, it seems like we've started to turn. There's seven, eight, nine numbers that all feel like they've barely started to turn, but it's barely. But all of our checks, it looks like things are -- hit the bottom last quarter and just are starting to slightly improve. So hopefully that's how things play out. But we're feeling like we have our arms wrapped around the situation much better and we feel like we're in a much better position in terms of the relationship that we have with our customers and our ability to sell consumption, our ability to get our customers over to consumption, training up the reps, training up the client services folks, focusing on adoption and helping people find these additional use cases. So, we feel like we're much better positioned and feel like we've got much better visibility into the customers and the contracts at this stage.
Eric Martinuzzi: Understand. Good luck in Q4.
Josh James: Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Oliver Crookenden with JMP Securities.
Pat Walravens: Actually, it's Pat, but -- Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Thank you. So, Josh, I do love the shift to consumption, and we've seen a lot of other people do it, but I was wondering if you could balance it out a little bit. I mean, there are some negatives to the consumption model, too, right? So, what do you give up when you make this shift?
Josh James: Yeah, we -- I think if you went around the room and e-staff and tried to figure out what the negatives are, I don't -- we're not seeing any negatives. The one difference in the model is you're not going to sign up any seven-figure new logo deals, right? When you go start to use AWS, you don't walk in and be like, ""Hey, give me a couple of million bucks worth."" You try it out and you start spending it and if you like it, you decide that you want to commit to get lower rates, and we're seeing that same thing. So, brand new seven-figure buildings walking in the door, we're not going to have as many of those. They'll happen, but they'll happen as those customers grow. So, we're seeing those relationships. We have some really big customers that are signing up right now that on the old seat model, we'd be signing up for $3 million, $4 million, but -- annually. But in the consumption model, you sign them up for $400,000 and then another $500,000, and then you get to a couple of million bucks. And you still get to the same spot. You get there more efficiently, more effectively. There's not as many -- not as much hemming and hawing. You're not going through as many use cases and approvals internally, but at the same time, you also don't have the big billings hits until they've had time to bake. So, we'll have to wait for some of those things to bake a little bit.
Pat Walravens: Okay, great.
David Jolley: I think, Pat, another -- just another comment was that I think early on there was a concern, well, geez, if we're giving them whole platform, is there going to be anything to sell them later on? And there was some concern about that. But the way that's working is when we provide the whole platform and open up all the seats, it's then just about helping the customer identify how to solve more of their data issues and more use cases. And as they do that, that's the upsell. It happens very naturally.
Pat Walravens: Okay. So, there's not a near-term hit on cash flow, like you don't get less cash upfront when you go to a consumption model? I mean, maybe not...
David Jolley: No. I mean still AIA...
Josh James: subscription.
David Jolley: Yeah, subscription AIA. So...
Pat Walravens: Okay. Perfect. And then, my second question is, Josh, if you could go a little deeper -- actually, I'm able to tell you my other two question, I'll put them up out front. So, for Josh, if you could go a little deeper on the architectural change and help us understand the history of that, what was it before and what is it now and how does it work? And then, maybe if you guys could address the debt in a little more detail, just sort of what's the current rate, when's the current -- when's the maturity and what's your options look like? Both of those things would be really helpful. Thank you.
Josh James: Yeah. So, the problem before, when we were starting to get excited about the ecosystem and we were building relationships with some folks, especially the big data providers, we'd walk into accounts with reps, and then their customer that they introduced us to might start pulling some compute out of our partner and putting it into Domo. And of course, that's the end of those relationships, right? You're taking dollars out of the pockets of the reps of the partners. And so that was DOA as soon as that started. And so, what we've done now is we said, okay, we can take that compute component, where the data lives and how it gets queried and processed, and we can run that inside Snowflake or inside AWS or inside Microsoft. So, any partner that brings us in, we can keep all the computing charges and credits that are being used up actually with the partner. And so that changes the dynamic pretty meaningfully because now we have complete alignment except for instead of 40 users that you may have at -- even a big Fortune 500 company, from 40 users or 100 users to 5,000, 10,000, when you add the Domo front-end on top of that. And that's 5,000 and 10,000 people that are now querying and running reports that are all driving compute on the back-end of a Snowflake or a Databricks or a Microsoft or an AWS or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). So, we feel like we're in a much, much better position. And that coupled with premium, there's been plenty of conversations where we're talking to a partner and someone that maybe we have 300 customers that have connected to their data. So, we know it's popular inside our network and we know that we provide a lot of visibility into the data that's inside that partner's analytics and the partner will come to us and say, ""Gosh, it'd be great if we could give this to the other 10,000 customers that we have."" And then we say, ""Yeah, great. You should do that. It's, let's see, $840,000."" And the partners like, ""What? Well, we don't know the values yet."" We're like, ""Yeah. But we will give you upside if they converted to the Domo customers."" They're like, ""Yeah, that seems like a good idea on paper, but I don't know if we can lean in and make the commitment, make the investment without seeing a return. So, maybe we should just try it out with a couple of customers."" And by then, you've lost momentum. Whereas now, we can go in that same customer, that same conversation, we say, ""Yes, we can get it to all 10,000. Let's do it on freemium. Let's build some quick start guides so that the second you roll this out, the customer is able to log into Domo, see all of the data from you as a partner. We'll build out the dashboards. We'll build out the alerts."" They're going to get this great white-glove, perfect experience replicated 10,000 times automatically. And in there, they can see, ""Hey, this is your Domo experience for this data from your partner. If you want it for everything else, here's your freemium account, just keep going."" And then, we tell the partner, ""Any upside, we're going to give you guys a piece of it."" So all of a sudden, providing data to their customers becomes not a cost center, it becomes a profit center. And we've seen a bunch of traction in just even the last month for that. So, we're really excited about our ability to provide Domo Everywhere through our freemium offering.
Pat Walravens: Great. And then, Dave, on the debt?
David Jolley: Yeah. So, our current debt, as you might recall, we raised that debt even prior to our IPO when we were still using a lot -- consuming a lot of cash. And so, it's very expensive debt. It carries a cash interest component and a PIK interest component, some other payments that push the effective interest rate north of 14% is where we're at today. And it's got a maturity of April '25. And so, we've gone out with a refinancing and got a bank helping us, and we're looking at cash interest component of a little over 11% right now based on where SOFR is at. We're hearing some good things about where rates might go next year, but it'll bring our rate down substantially and push our maturity date out to '29 or '30. So, it sort of puts it out well out into the future and it eliminates some of the other PIK interest and some of the other elements.
Pat Walravens: All right, terrific. Thanks to both of you.
Operator: One moment everyone, the speaker line has disconnected. One moment we reestablish the audio. Once again, everyone, please stand by. We'll establish that audio line momentarily. Please stay on the line. Once again everyone, you are on hold for the Domo, Inc. conference call. We are establishing the speaker line. Please stand by. You are now live.
Josh James: All right. Sounds like Pat said thanks, we heard, and there was another question. Is the question still on?
Operator: Yes. One moment. We'll take our next question from Derrick Wood with T.D. Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thanks. This is Cole on for Derek. On the RIF that you talked about, we'd just like to get a little bit more color. Is that across sales, G&A? If you can just unpack that a bit, that'd be helpful.
Josh James: Yeah, we -- it was across every department. There was -- the majority of it was in sales. We're in terms of growth, not where we want to be. And so for the most part, it was based on performance. Some of it was just positions that were eliminated, as we found a more optimized way of accomplishing certain things. It wasn't a huge number, but it was still several dozen humans that were affected. So, a little bit of a rough day here at the office, but at the same time, I feel like the company is in a better position. And it's not a dramatic effect on our ability to produce. We think in many cases, actually, taking a smaller number of leads distributed -- I mean, taking the same number of leads distributed to a smaller number of reps will actually be an improvement for the reps that are here to make sure that they're being fed. So, overall, I don't think it's going to be too impactful to our company. It just, obviously, impacts the folks that were affected by it.
Unidentified Analyst: Sounds good. Helpful. Just building on that too, for the reps that you still have at Domo, how is productivity trending? Any new initiatives around helping them sell consumption better would be helpful to hear about things.
Josh James: Yeah, we have all kinds of initiatives around helping them to consumption. We had a Board meeting just recently and walked through our consumption deck and showed the Board members all the positive things that are happening and all the negative things that we might be able to find as well. And the resounding answer was -- from the Board was, ""Move as fast as you possibly can. We don't see anything that would cause us concern about you moving as fast as you possibly can."" So, to that end, doing as many things as we can to drive the transition to consumption, things like we've built out a brand new adoption group that's focused on going into our -- especially our bigger customers, and helping them, it's a great phone call. We call a customer, and we're not asking for a new contract. We're not asking to go get approval from procurement. We're just walking in saying, ""Hey, we'd love to come in and show you best uses for data science,"" or ""We'd love to come in and talk to you about identifying opportunities inside your marketing spend."" And they love those conversations. All we're doing is walking in and helping them, but we're helping them identify additional use cases, which, of course, ends up driving consumption. So those are the types of things that we're doing with the customer. And then, we're re-evaluating the different departments that we have and what each group does. So, reps, their job on renewal. What's what is the job on renewal? Is the job to go and procure another contract, or is the job to help identify some more use cases? And so, just identifying those different ways that we can interact with our customers to help get them excited about adding additional users and adding additional use cases. It's really fun for the customer, and it's really fun for us. They end up happier. They end up spending more. And those are the types of things that we can really do to address transitions to consumption. There are some customers that are on seat-based licenses with us, and they don't have access to all the features. We have new features rolling out all the time, and if you want to use those features, then you need to be on consumption. And so, as we go out and market the different product offerings that we have and the new product offerings that we have, those all lead to additional consumption conversation. So, we're definitely laser-focused on that. We've seen this 20% cohort of consumption that's in our business today. And it looks better than every other 20% cohort that you could find. So, we're going to do anything and everything we can to get the entire business moved over to that because just everyone ends up happier on the consumption model.
Unidentified Analyst: Appreciate the color. Thanks.
Josh James: Yeah, you bet. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.
Sanjit Singh: Yeah, thank you for squeezing me in. And sorry, I've been toggling between multiple calls, so if I'm repeating a question, I apologize upfront. But David, just given the -- sort of the refinancing of the debt and sort of the higher rate environment and given the sort of actions you guys are doing today on cost, to what extent could debt pay down be part of like the capital allocation strategy, given that the budget environment is still pretty constrained right now? How do you look at debt pay down a potential lever for increasing sort of the equity value?
David Jolley: Yeah. I mean the good thing is even sort of as is with a very modest growth expectation for next year, I think we're free cash flow positive, which puts us in a great position. So, if we're able to accomplish some of the things that Josh talked about in accelerating our shift to consumption, and if we get any sort of help from the macro environment, then we're into producing some meaningful cash flow that then could be used to potentially retire some debt. As you know, there's usually some penalties when you pay it down in the first year. So, we'll look at that. But I think it'll be -- probably will be a lot better position as we move into some of those succeeding years to start reducing that well in advance of maturity, certainly.
Sanjit Singh: Great. I appreciate the thoughts. And then, Josh, on -- I was just kind of coming out of the AWS conference, and when I hear about people's data strategies, one of the bigger themes is sort of English being the new programming language and English being the new SQL. And just want to get a sense of how you guys are sort of abstracting away kind of traditional BI type user interfaces to more of that generative AI modality where users are just sort of using natural language, English, to get the insights that they need from Domo?
Josh James: Yeah, I mean it's terribly exciting because one of the most challenging things in business intelligence or in leveraging the data that you have in your company is just getting access to it. And the big part of getting access to it is connecting to it, all of the ETL that needs to go into it. And you're right, that's where these antiquated languages used to be a big part of it. And going forward, it is about English. And we have a bunch of stuff that we've already incorporated into our products, a bunch of AI that we've incorporated into our product, and a bunch of generative AI that we're going to be incorporating over the next few months into exploring the data, into building cards, into sharing data, having a data set and having AI suggest to you what you should look at, what format it should look like, being able to pick and choose from things that it suggests to you, fully formed reports. And so, it's going to dramatically alter the landscape. It's going to dramatically alter the interactions and the benefits that the customers get. So, we're really excited about that. We feel like we're extremely well positioned. When you look at the data that powers AI, it all depends on how organized that data is. And if your data is organized like a bunch of trash, then that's exactly what you're going to get back. When you use Domo, you actually not only organize your data, but you have a bunch of metadata about that data. And that's what helps AI really come up with great conclusions when it actually has an indication of what type of data is sitting there because in the data world it could be anything. It could be unstructured, messy data, and it might be data that's coming from another data warehouse. You actually don't know the root source of it, and so you need to be able to have the metadata around that and have data organized in a way. And that's one of the things that we really do with our customers, is help them organize that so that they can take advantage of all the different technologies and innovations that are rapidly coming out from AI. So, we feel like we're extremely well positioned for that. And that's another big part of why we want to be in the middle of consumption, because again, if you're using consumption, anything that is in our product, you can try out. It's going to cost you a buck to try it out. It's not a $50,000 commitment and you've got to buy a couple seats. It's just go and click on it, see what it does, see if it produces something that's effective. And then, if it does, of course, you're going to start using it more. And because you already know it's effective, even though you're using it more, you're getting a bill for it, you don't care because you already proved the value. So that's just another reason why consumption is such an important part of this, where we see 2x, 3x usage of the additional features and functionality we have in our product when it's a consumption customer, because they're able to try it out and prove that it works. So, we're really excited about AI and the way it's going to impact our business, broadly speaking, and feel like we're really well positioned to take advantage of that.
Sanjit Singh: Appreciate the thoughts, Josh. Thank you.
Josh James: You bet. Thanks.
Operator: And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation today, and you may now disconnect.

It guarantees the lowest space power and e-waste in the industry and provides infrastructure and services that always get better with age without disruption. The Pure Storage platform also promises a cloud operating model for our customers, enabling them to manage their data storage like the cloud providers to reduce their storage costs in the cloud to provide tailored storage services to their developers like the cloud and to consume storage like the cloud as a service. This model is gaining traction with leading customers. Evergreen//One, our Storage as a Service consumption offering saw continued extraordinary growth, more than doubling year-over-year. Evergreen//One and Evergreen/Flex are our preferred services for providing customers data storage on a consumption basis. Although we continue to offer customers the choice of consuming storage as CapEx, we believe the continued high demand for Evergreen//One is being driven by our sales activities, new customer buying behavior, and the current macro environment. Customers are attracted to the ability to manage and consume Evergreen storage as a cloud service as they need it. But with the low cost advanced capabilities and data security of on-prem storage. The outperformance of Evergreen//One this year has been significantly above our prior expectations and we now expect this strong level of demand to continue through Q4. While this success is a long anticipated and welcome expansion of our business model, its overperformance will have an effect on near-term revenue, which Kevan will cover in detail. In Q3, Pure set a new industry standard with eight service level agreement or SLA guarantees across our Evergreen services. With the innovative new paid power and rack program, we pay our Evergreen customers power and rack space costs. This first-of-a-kind program is enabled by our ability to deliver the cloud attributes that customers desire with the most energy efficient and reliable storage technology. Paid power and rack directly addresses the increasing cost of electricity and data center space. Additional SLAs introduced in Q3 and guarantee no change related downtime, no future data migrations for hardware replacements, upgrades or expansions and zero data loss. Portworx, our Kubernetes and container storage software for cloud native applications also had a record quarter. Portworx was recently named a leader in the inaugural IDC Marketscape for container data management. We saw increased multiyear renewals from existing customers and new customers deploying the Portworx suite of products for multi-cloud databases, messaging and logging systems. Portworx was also selected by a leading global retailer to provide a single integrated platform for their machine learning researchers and analysts ensuring consistent models across multiple clouds. A large international government authority is supporting their artificial intelligence and machine learning environments with Portworx deployed in mission-critical cloud-based applications. Customer momentum in the field of artificial intelligence also continues for Pure with a double-digit number of AI wins in the quarter across our portfolio. This included era technology and AI-based decision intelligence and automation platform that chose our Portworx solution for seamless cloud integration, outperforming competitive solutions by 200%. And Olympus adopted Pure's AI-ready infrastructure based on a FlashBlade and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) solution for a new AI development environment, ensuring performance and capacity for large-scale models to accelerate their success with transformative AI solutions. We remain our customers' preferred partner for AI deployments and have strengthened our innovation and leadership by earning NVIDIA-based pod certification. Aerie, our complete AI-ready infrastructure built on the NVIDIA DGX base pod reference architecture and the latest FlashBlade//S storage platform makes AI scaling and deployments faster and easier for our customers. We continue to see strong demand for FlashBlade//E. And this month, we announced the general availability of FlashArray//E and shipped our first orders. This past quarter, we announced our latest Gartner accolade, a leader in the Magic Quadrant for distributed file systems and object storage, and it's now three years running. This marks the tenth successive year overall that our leadership has been acknowledged by Gartner in transforming the storage industry. The early success of our E family reinforces our belief that flash is replacing this enlarging Pure's opportunity in enterprise and eventually cloud storage. In Q3, Pure scored another major win for new 5G infrastructure to be deployed in our fiscal 2025. Pure's continuing success in the 5G space is based on our superior performance, reliability, density, longevity and advanced remote management capabilities. We are seeing strong early customer interest in our expanded partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the Pure Cloud Block store integration with Azure VMware (NYSE:VMW) Solution, also known as AVS. Pure and Microsoft announced the public preview of this service this quarter. CVS and AVS are providing customers the opportunity to reduce their cloud storage spend by half or more while providing them the advanced services that they experience with Pure's enterprise systems. Customers are also enthusiastic about managing their storage and data across data centers and clouds in a consistent hybrid environment. Despite the uncertainties of the current business environment, Pure superior low total cost of ownership and Evergreen offerings are making a difference in this challenging IT economy. We are seeing a strong positive response to our position of having a consistent, unified flash platform for all storage needs from the data center to the cloud. This position is enabling us to compete for ever larger footprints in large enterprise accounts. This, coupled with the strong overall demand for our platform gives me the confidence in our continued ability to take share and outpace the market. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan for further commentary.
Kevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie. We are pleased with our financial results this quarter. We delivered strong revenue and operating profit, both above our prior guidance for the quarter. Revenue was $763 million, up 13% year-over-year, and operating profit was $169 million. The macro spending environment remains relatively consistent to what we have seen throughout this year. However, demand for our solutions was robust throughout Q3. Our business strategy continues to focus on transitioning our offerings for our customers to consumption and subscription services. These types of offerings provide more value to our customers, which is resonating as customer demand for our consumption and subscription-based offerings across our Evergreen portfolio, especially Evergreen//One and Portworx is very strong. We achieved another quarter of record sales of our FlashBlade portfolio, including FlashBlade//E, which has quickly grown to become a meaningful portion of our FlashBlade business since becoming generally available in late April. We are also seeing customers consuming our FlashBlade technology, including FlashBlade as a service, leveraging our Evergreen//One Storage as a Service offering. Our operating profit of $169 million in Q3 exceeded expectations. Our differentiated flash management technology powered by purity software operating natively with raw flash continues to be a key driver of our strong product and subscription gross margins. As we mentioned last quarter, the majority of our capacity shipped is based on QLC raw flash. Remaining Performance Obligations or RPO was very strong and exceeds $2 billion growing 30%. During Q3, we closed a large non-cancellable product order with a large telco customer totaling $41 million that is included in the RPO balance at the end of Q3. Based on the timing of the shipment schedule for this order, product revenue is not expected until next year, which impacts our revenue outlook this year, which I'll discuss further in my remarks when updating annual guidance. When excluding both the noncancelable product order from RPO in the current quarter and the outstanding commitment in Q3 of last year with one of our global system integrators, RPO growth for our subscription services was also very strong at 29%. As we mentioned last quarter, the outstanding commitment with our global system integrator was fully satisfied during Q1 of this year. In Q3, subscription services annual recurring revenue grew 26% year-over-year to nearly $1.3 billion, highlighting the strong traction for our consumption and subscription-based service offerings. As we have mentioned previously, closed Evergreen//One contracts where the effective service date has not started are excluded from the subscription services ARR calculation including closed Evergreen//One contracts where the service date has not yet started, subscription services ARR was also strong, growing 27%. Subscription services revenue of $310 million comprised 41% of total revenue. U.S. revenue for Q3 was $536 million and international revenue was $227 million. Our new customer acquisition grew sequentially as we acquired 353 new customers during the quarter. As previously mentioned, we were pleased with our strong gross margin performance of 74%. Product gross margin was 73.1%, and subscription services gross margin was 75.4%. Our headcount increased slightly to approximately 5,500 employees at the end of the quarter. Pure's balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong, including $1.35 billion in cash and investments at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $158 million and capital expenditures totaled $45 million. In Q2, we repurchased over 630,000 shares of stock, returning over $22 million to our shareholders. Consistent with our remarks last quarter, our share repurchases represent a lower level of repurchase activity as a result of the fixed trading parameters that were in place throughout the quarter. We have approximately $167 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization. Now turning to our updated annual guidance for FY '24. A key assumption used to derive our FY '24 annual revenue guide at the beginning of the year was that the macro environment would not meaningfully improve or deteriorate throughout the year. This assumption is holding as the spending environment continues to be challenging. Though despite these challenges, we are seeing increasing demand in the second half of the year across our data storage platform especially for consumption and subscription service offerings. Although we expect the demand to increase for the second half of the year, there are two important factors that are impacting our annual revenue expectation this year, which we now expect to be $2.82 billion, growing 2.5% and Q4 revenue is expected to be $782 million, declining 3.5%. First is the impact of our Evergreen//One Storage as a Service momentum, which will be discussed in more detail. And second is the impact of a $41 million non-canceled product order with a telco customer that is not expected to be fulfilled until next year. Both factors on a combined basis represent approximately 4.5 points of incremental headwind when compared to the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year. We are very pleased with the momentum and growth of our Evergreen//One service offering, while appreciating that this momentum creates a short-term impact on revenue growth. Last quarter, we stated that sales of our Evergreen//One service offering was expected to create 1 to 2 points of headwind to the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year. Based on our Evergreen//One sales in Q3 and the opportunities in our seasonally largest quarter Q4, we now expect that annual sales of our Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex offerings will more than double this year, reaching nearly $400 million and expect the impact will now create 3 points of headwind to the annual guide we provided at the beginning of the year. When excluding the impacts of the increased shift to our Evergreen//One offering and a $41 million order with a telco customer, our annual revenue growth would have been 7% when compared against the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year. We expect that our consumption and subscription business models will drive improved long-term growth for Pure as our subscription and consumption business continues to grow, we will provide additional business metrics that will help measure the health of our business. This includes translating growth rates of our subscription and consumption service offerings to a growth rate under our traditional model of a CapEx sale. Finally, we are increasing our annual operating margin guidance from 15.5% to 16% driven by our continued operational discipline and gross margin strength. Q4 operating margin is expected to be approximately 19%. In closing, we are pleased with the strength and demand across our entire Pure Storage platform, including our expectation of more than doubling sales this year of our combined Evergreen//One Storage as a Service and Evergreen//Flex offerings. We could not be more excited with how our solutions resonate with our customers, delivering a consistent, nondisruptive operating and management environment, leveraging the most advanced flash technology. Our innovation across our storage platform also extends to our Evergreen business models, providing customers with increasing flexibility and business value. With that, I will turn it back to Paul for Q&A.
Paul Ziots: Thanks, Kevan. [Operator Instructions] Operator, let's get started.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of Evercore. You may proceed.
Amit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess maybe to start the discussion, there's obviously a lot of focus on the Jan quarter guide and the delta that's there versus seasonality versus what you expected 90 days ago. I realize there are a fair number of cross currents out there. But to the extent you can maybe talk about how much of the shortfall versus your expectations 90 days ago, let's say, is micro versus macro. I'd love to get a sense if you think anything has shifted from Pure's competitive advantage of your positioning that's impacting it. And I realize Evergreen//One is a big part of it. I'd love to kind of understand why do you think customers are massively increasing the shift towards Evergreen//One versus buying storage in a traditional manner. Thank you.
Charlie Giancarlo: Thanks Amit. Yes. Well, you nailed it, Amit, the shift to the consumption model has just continued to be very, very strong. And as you know, this is a model that we've been investing in for well over five years. It's one that we had staked a lot of our anticipation in and moving forward with, but this year has just been very strong. And one could say that it's the macro that has driven greater interest in a consumption model, I think, for obvious reasons, for the customer. But even more than that, we've invested in it heavily to make it not just a subscription and therefore, an easier bite, if you will, for economically difficult times. But to make it a true cloud service where they manage it like the cloud, it is hands-off. And now we're even paying for their power and rack space so that it's - other than the fact that it sits on their premise, it's a true cloud service. So the uptake in this, especially in these more difficult challenging times has been tremendous. So the two are tightly aligned. The macro overall certainly hasn't helped. Better macro would have lifted all boats. But really, the change as you put it, it was driven primarily by the shift to subscription and consumption model.
Kevan Krysler: Yes. Thanks, Charlie. This is Kevan. And how're you doing Amit? If you take a step back and really look at the change in our annual guide as well as the impact to Q4, it really does come down to two key factors that we've described. One is what Charlie has highlighted, which is the strength and momentum of Evergreen//One. And then the second, obviously, is the telco order. That was all product that's having an impact on Q4 as well.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Amit. Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Aaron Rakers: Thanks for taking the question. Yes. Just to kind of build on Amit's question there. I guess if I'm doing the math right, it looks like you're talking about an impact of about $80 million, $85 million from this higher Evergreen//One contribution. So I guess the question is like what would that number look like just actually three months ago embedded in your expectation? And how do I think about -- you threw out a number, $400 million. Is that $400 million of ARR contribution. Just help me understand what $400 million is and how fast this necessarily could grow into the next year? Just thinking about incremental headwinds from this transition to this consumption model here as we move forward.
Kevan Krysler: Yes. How're you doing, Arron, this is Kevan. The $400 million is really our sales of Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex for the year. So think about that as a TCV of sales during the year. And then if you - if we take a step back into exiting Q2 and going into Q3, we had talked about the fact that our annual guide range had contemplated strong growth. We were adding about another 1 to 2 points of headwind to that growth exiting Q2. And then with the strength that we've seen in Q3 on Evergreen//One as well as what we're seeing in terms of volume and opportunities in Q4, that headwind now has been increased to 3 points. So again, and your math is about right in terms of the effects in absolute dollars when in context to our annual revenue guide. And then tacking on to that, the telco order, which is having an impact as well.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Aaron. Next question, please.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Meta (NASDAQ:META) Marshall of Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of questions. One, just on any update on how you're seeing kind of your - or probability of kind of Meta order coming back at least sometime in the next fiscal year? And then just a second question on - I mean, I would assume you would have said that the conditions are largely staying the same for most of this year. And so has this Evergreen transition been a headwind for kind of more than this quarter and it just culminated into something you couldn't kind of make up for given not seeing a better environment? Or just how have you seen this evergreen transition kind of progress throughout the year? Thanks.
Charlie Giancarlo: Let me start with the Meta question. So we continued - Meta continues to be a good customer. We have not - generally, when - on these calls, we talk about contribution by RSE. No meaningful contribution to RSE this past quarter, but we've had sales to Meta in other segments. And that relationship continues to blossom as far as we're concerned. It continues to get better, and we expect to continue to see good opportunities in Meta as we go forward. And then the second one was the...
Kevan Krysler: You want to clarify your second question as well.
Meta Marshall: The second question is just it's clearly a headwind as we go into fiscal Q4, this kind of Evergreen transition. But given probably much of the macro environment has stayed stable during the year, how much of a headwind has it been in previous quarters that you were just kind of able to accommodate for? I guess I'm just trying to say or get a sense of how much of that is new this quarter versus this has been a headwind for the entire year?
Charlie Giancarlo: Well, almost - if I might start. One, because we've had such strong growth in Evergreen//One. It has been a bit of a headwind the whole year, but it had never been sustained the way it is this year. We had good quarters, like every other new program you have strong quarters and then it's balanced off by other quarters where the specific opportunity in this case, Evergreen//One was a bit weaker. And when we saw the growth in Evergreen//One early in the year, as we -- as you may remember, the economy turned weak around Q4 last year, and so we were expecting Evergreen//One to pick up. What's really different this time around is just the continued strength quarter-over-quarter and visibility into Q4 now as well, the strength there. So yes, but it's becoming a more meaningful number now.
Kevan Krysler: Yes. And if I would just to add on to that, to what Charlie was saying, it really is an accumulation of effect. So starting with our annual revenue guide that we provided, obviously, there were two components that were key in that guide of mid-to high single digits. One was contemplation of the macro environment. And second was, we were considering momentum of Evergreen//One when we came into the year. Now exiting Q2, we added on 1 to 2 points of additional headwind as a result of what we were seeing, both for Q1 and Q2 and our visibility to Q3. Now Q3 outperformed even our raised expectations in Q4 looks very strong as well. And so you do have the accumulation effect going on, but lastly, when we think about Q3, there was definitely more pressure on product revenue as a result of the momentum we were seeing with Evergreen//One. And the sales team did a really nice job executing throughout the quarter. And part of this strong execution included accelerating fulfillment and probably of a subset of product orders that would have been expected to close in Q4. So there is an impact there as well. And hopefully, that adds some additional color for you there.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Meta. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Tim Long of Barclays. You may proceed.
Tim Long: Thank you. Could we just talk a little bit more about the double-digit AI wins in the quarter. Maybe just give us a little more color there on kind of how big these deals are coming out. Any product portfolio that you have that's differentiated, that's winning there kind of timing to see some revenue recognition from these deals? That would be helpful. Thank you.
Rob Lee: Yes, absolutely, Tim. This is Rob. I'll take that one. Certainly, AI, inclusive of traditional AI and generative AI is and continues to be a strong segment for us. But more importantly, what we've seen this quarter is a variety of AI wins really across all of the areas of the AI-driven opportunity for us here at Pure. And that's number one, certainly, the training infrastructure environments. Number two, the inference and AI application environments, as well as number three, some of the broader data environments that are being connected to these AI workflows. And so if we look at the AI training infrastructure, look, this - we've been in the space for years, continues to be a strong area for us. As an example, this quarter, we had a large automaker, expand their FlashBlade footprint, really driving their autonomous driving efforts as well as number two, we saw customers really deploying both our Portworx as well as our flash array solutions as part of their inference AI application environments. And then thirdly, as we look at the opportunity around the broader data management and data preparation environments, these are equally important parts of AI deployments. And we saw some good wins in both of these - in these areas as well, serving both customers' database and data preparation applications as well as some other bulk data repositories connected to these environments. And so if I net it out continues to be a strong segment for us and look, if we look at the opportunity in terms of both the GPU connected environments as well, the larger data environments being driven by AI technology, we're well positioned across the entire portfolio to benefit from these deployments.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Tim. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Noah on for Pinjalim. Thanks for taking our question. I guess how should we really think about fiscal year 2025? And what are really some of the puts and takes you can highlight there especially when we think about the seasonality of the business given all the moving parts going forward? Thank you.
Kevan Krysler: Yes. Thanks for the question. And really, we won't go into a lot of detail specific to next year. We want to navigate through our seasonally largest quarter, which is Q4. But I think two important things to take away that we're seeing. One is that demand has strengthened and is expected to strengthen through the first half, and that's a good sign for us. And second is the momentum on for Evergreen//One and strength we're seeing for a variety of reasons that Charlie walked through. And so both those factors will be in play in terms of how we think about next year, but would want to get through Q4 before providing anything more specific for next year.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Noah. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Krish Sankar of TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Krish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the $40 million telco order. It seems like a pretty big number on a quarterly basis. I was under the impression you have such a high customer concentration. So can you talk a little bit about that? And also, is this being used for 5G applications what kind of application is being useful. Thank you.
Charlie Giancarlo: Yes. No, we highlighted that it is, in fact, a 5G application environment that this is going into. And I would say in order of this type in one quarter is not terribly unusual for us. It does happen from time to time. And 5G has been a very strong market for us. The advantages that we have in space, power and cooling, reliability and longevity of the product in its remote management capability really aligns well with telco and especially 5G, which is a very distributed environment. And I will say, although it's unusual for us in general, it's not unusual in the telco space to have scheduled shipments aligning with their upgrades to their distributed 5G environment. So our typical business in IT and other areas is book and ship within weeks. This is a scheduled shipment based on build outs - their build-out schedule of their 5G environment.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Krish. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Sidney Ho: Thank you for the question. I want to look at the product growth - actually, gross margin is very, very good at 74%, curious about the sustainability of that, particularly if you look at the product gross margin being 73.1%, looking forward, how would you characterize the pricing environment, especially given many of your competitors have access to lower price and components now? And what specifically do you have to be more aggressive in pricing in order to keep or win businesses, especially in areas that are starting to see more competition? Thanks.
Charlie Giancarlo: Thank you, Sidney. We intend to be very aggressive in pricing and especially as we penetrate the lower price performance tiers of the disk market. It's a new market for flash and the opportunity there is huge, more than half of the overall enterprise storage market, and we believe we have a special opportunity that ahead of every other player in the market. So our intention is the E family grows is to be very aggressive in that segment. Frankly, as you point out, the 73 is above our intended range for product gross margins. And we're going to use that a natural cost advantage we have to continue to gain market share.
Rob Lee: And just to add on to that, I think it's important to just highlight and remember that because of our flash management technology and direct flash, we've got a sustained and significant structural advantage over the competitive set who are trapped an SSD-based technology. Because of the direct flash, we can deliver products that are less complex, more reliable, more efficient, more performance. And at the end of the day, that translates to better products delivered in a more cost-effective way. And behind that, our Purity software really is that differentiation. And so just to - again, just to add on to Charlie's points, the advantages that we have really are structural and sustainable, driven by our significant software and hardware IP.
Kevan Krysler: So I'm just going to add to this a little bit more, taking a step back, agreeing that the gross margins across the board were very strong, and so we're quite pleased with that and validating and agreeing with obviously Charlie and Rob and really wanting to reiterate as well that the majority of our bits shipped now continue to be QLC, which ties into the continued innovation that we're driving. And look, we really do benefit from flash pricing, both improving and weakening and we are currently seeing some improvement in the NAND pricing. And then reiterating Charlie's point, from a financial lens with our strong product gross margins, we will be aggressive in our disk takeout strategy with our E family price performance solutions. As we think about our subscription growth margins, that's going to be a combination of our scale on our Evergreen offerings, including the consumption and subscription portfolio as a key contributor, also similar to the strength we're seeing in product margins, our Evergreen subscription gross margins are also benefiting from the structural advantages that Rob alluded to. So yes, definitely pleased with what we're seeing in terms of our margin performance overall.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Sidney. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of SIG (sic) [Susquehanna]. You may proceed.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. It's actually Mehdi Hosseini. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to better understand Evergreen//One. To follow-up here, would this impact your working capital requirement? And is there anywhere in the balance sheet that we could look and better track the traction with Evergreen//One model?
Kevan Krysler: Yes. I think the key metric, obviously, we added a new metric this quarter, which was the total sales this year expected for the combined Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex model and that being $400 million over doubling year-over-year. So that would be a new metric that we've added that hopefully is helpful. The other metric that I think is helpful is the RPO metric and obviously, our strength in growth in RPO is really being driven by our Evergreen//One momentum that we've seen throughout the year, including Q3. And then layering on to that would be our subscription services ARR growth, which is also quite strong. So those are the metrics I'd probably point you to in assessing the health around our consumption and subscription services business.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Mehdi. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Simon Leopold of Raymond James. You may proceed.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just - first, a quick clarification. I appreciate you're not ready to guide for fiscal '25, but I think it would be helpful to get a little bit of handholding given that your April quarter, your first quarter is typically down teens double digits, but you've got kind of this tough situation in the January quarter. So just some clarification on that. And then the question I wanted to ask, and I love Charlie's description of the competitive environment as a nice fight in the phone booth. I'd love to get some updates there, in that what you're seeing and hearing in terms of competitive actions and your ability to displace both hybrid flash competitors as well as hard disk drive competitors. Thank you.
Kevan Krysler: Yes. I'll hit the discussion for next year, again without providing a lot of details. But as you think about the setup for next year, it is critical for us to navigate through Q4 and our expectations through Q4. But this is really not, in my mind, a seasonal question. It's really about Evergreen//One and the performance of Evergreen//One. And if we take a step back, and look at the Evergreen//One momentum and the telco order, we should be for this year at 7% growth. And so what we've seen on top of that and what we're seeing in the second half is strengthening demand. And I would hope to see that as we continue through Q4 and as we move into next year. So that would be a data point for consideration. We talked about 3 points on the annual guide against the annual guide of headwind for Evergreen//One. Look, we're expecting momentum to continue on Evergreen//One. We're actually thrilled that we're seeing an inflection point with our customers with that model. And so we'll have to provide more color for you as we move through Q4, specific to the Evergreen//One momentum next year. Charlie?
Charlie Giancarlo: Yes. In terms of selling and what the competitive situation looks like out in the field, I'd say it's as competitive as ever, perhaps, so a little less gross margins generally have been improving. So perhaps the pricing environment has been a little bit better, but I would say, overall, the competition is as tough as ever, both in the channel and directly with customers overall. What I will say is, having perusing as we always do, our overall win rates and at bets. Our overall win rates hold very steady against our competitors. So - but it is a tough environment without doubt.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Simon. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital Market. You may proceed.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Thanks. I want to double click here on Slide 17. Your unbilled RPO, I've always sort of reviewed that as a good proxy for your Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex sales. A, is that true? And then I'll go from there.
Kevan Krysler: Nehal, that is true. And then I would add on to that specific for this quarter would be the telco order that we've been highlighting and discussing as well.
Nehal Chokshi: Right. Okay. So the Q-o-Q change in unbilled RPO $100 million, take out that $40 million for the Telco order, then you're talking about $60 million. That's still a significant increase. And if I just simply do it on a cumulative two-year basis, for this year relative to a year ago, that's more than a doubling on a year-over-year basis. So can you talk about the linearity that you're seeing in this acceleration in Evergreen//Flex, was there relatively sold in the first two quarters and now an explosion in the third quarter and then you expect sort of some sort of normalization in the fourth quarter here?
Kevan Krysler: Yes. And it's primarily Evergreen//One. And we've talked about what we've seen this year is a cumulative build and momentum of Evergreen//One. So again, coming out of the year and developing our guide for the year, we had contemplated a really significant growth in Evergreen//One. And again, as we navigated through Q1 and Q2, we saw that that growth rate was impacted a little bit more 1 to 2 points against our annual guide. Now that we've been through Q3 and our visibility to Q4, now that's about 3 points incremental to what we had provided in our annual guide. So this has been a cumulative effect. And as Charlie has pointed out, really seeing an inflection point in part, I think, due to the macro, but I also think customers are really embracing the value of this business model as well.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Nehal. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. You may proceed.
Wamsi Mohan: Hi, thanks so much. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some update on how we should think about CapEx given the increased momentum of Storage as a Service. And where are you in terms of the build-out when you think about maybe this continued momentum of Evergreen//One, what sort of revenue level can the infrastructure that you currently have support? Thank you.
Kevan Krysler: Yes. I don't think we'll see a lot of change in terms of how we're thinking about our CapEx. Obviously, we had higher CapEx as well this year due to the build-out of our headquarters. Obviously, we've got a significant amount of innovation from an R&D perspective. So we've got some CapEx requirements there. And really, the only other big CapEx requirement is supporting the momentum of Evergreen//One. And so that's how we would be thinking about it from a CapEx perspective. And then obviously, you've got a layering on in terms of the subscription services revenue effect coming on as a result of the ramping Evergreen//One sales that we're seeing.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Wamsi. Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin of Stifel. You may proceed.
Matt Sheerin: Thank you. Commentary from one of your competitors last night pointed to a broader QLC-based adoption across the industry. So first, are you seeing any changes in the competitive landscape or market share pressure given some new product introduction. It sounds like from your previous comments that you're not seeing that. And second, can you add more color on the success you've seen so far with FlashBlade//E and expectations for the new array E? And any surprises in terms of use cases or types of customers?
Charlie Giancarlo: You bet. Well, I'll now refer to the E family given that we've now introduced FlashArray//E, which lowers the incoming price point, if you will, for customers from what was 4 petabytes on FlashBlade now down to 1 petabyte on flash array and even less if they take it as a service. So we really feel that it's a very, very strong product line. We have seen that entry by one of our competitors. E comes in substantially below that. We really feel the E - the competitors see offering is much closer to our C offering. So we're several years ahead of that. The competitive environment for our offering is still largely with disk. And disk - we say disk, but of course, disk comes in many flavors. And as we develop E further and further, we have to address all the different use cases that it's involved in, which is what drives its growth. That growth is still the fastest growth of any new product that we've had here at the company. So we're very pleased with the growth, but it's still at the - we're only two full quarters in. So it's - we anticipate that will be a much more meaningful part of our revenue next year.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Matt. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. You may proceed.
Eric Martinuzzi: Yes. Curious to know how you feel about your sales capacity is typically when you're evaluating your coverage for the coming year? Are you planning on adding sales?
Charlie Giancarlo: The answer is yes. We believe our capacity is at the level that we had planned for. And we're planning, obviously, to grow. So we are adding to our sales force have been throughout the year, but Q4 is a key time to bring in new players. And so we will be adding to our sales force.
Paul Ziots: Thank you, Eric. We have one more question. So next question will be the last question.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up question from the line of Krish Sankar of TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Krish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to follow up on the Evergreen//One. What sort of time frame are the - are these contracts, for example, just to like make it simple. You said it's a three percentage point headwind for your FY '24 outlook. It is very simply that the next two years are flat and because of this one, is it like a 1% uptake every over the next three years, if it's a three-year subscription model. I'm just kind of curious how to think about these Evergreen//One subscription.
Kevan Krysler: Yes, it's a great question. Look, if we look at the Evergreen//One orders that we've closed to date this year, we're probably averaging a little bit over 3.5 years in duration associated with that of those orders, which really is similar to our traditional CapEx commitments as well. So that's the answer in terms of duration that we're seeing.
Charlie Giancarlo: I do want to point out that these are consumption contracts. And so these are, in effect, minimums. The consumption goes higher, then, of course, we'd expect more. And of course, we expect the contracts to continue even after the contract is done.
Kevan Krysler: That's right, Charlie. And then when we calculate what the headwind is, and against - the headwind again is against our annual guide that we provided at the beginning of the year, we just basically translate the incremental growth we're seeing beyond the growth we had assumed in the annual - in the annual revenue guide that we provided, using about 70% going to product if it was a traditional CapEx sale. So that's how we're calculating the points of headwind against our annual revenue guide.
Operator: There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'll pass the conference over to the management team for closing remarks.
Charlie Giancarlo: Thank you, operator. Our strategy to provide customers a consistent, unified and modern storage platform for all their storage needs based on a cloud operating model continues to distinguish us in our industry and propel our success. And we believe the strength of our consumption offerings continues to outperform, benefiting both our customers and Pure. As we enter the holiday season, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks to all of our customers, our investors, partners, our suppliers and our employees. Your effort enables Pure to lead the industry in defining the next generation of data storage. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes the Pure Storage third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires TikTok and other designated gatekeepers Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to make their messaging apps interoperate with rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices. They are not allowed to favour their own services over rivals' or prevent users from removing pre-installed software or apps. TikTok last month challenged the EU decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court, saying its designation risks undermining the DMA goal of protecting gatekeepers from newer competitors like itself. ""We have applied for interim measures,"" a spokesperson said. 
The bar for the court to approve interim measures is very high. Companies must show that situation is urgent and that they would suffer irreparable harm without an interim measure. Meta and Apple have also sued the Commission over their gatekeeper status.",-0.8835

Shares fell 0.7% postmarket.
Amazon reported earnings  per share of $6.04 on revenue of $72.38 billion for its fourth quarter. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $5.64 on revenue of $71.87 billion.
But Amazon said it sees first-quarter sales of $56 billion to $60 billion, just below forecasts of $61.04 billion.
In addition it said fourth-quarter subscription services revenue, which includes its Prime delivery and Prime Video offerings, rose 26% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, well below recent trends.
Subscription services revenue grew more than 50% from the year-ago period in the first three quarter of 2018.
The e-commerce giant predicted operating income $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion in the first quarter, in line but on the low side of estimates for $3 billion.
The solid earnings but cautious revenue guidance is becoming a bit of a habit for the company. This is the third quarter in a row its revenue guidance has been below consensus.
For the fourth quarter, net sales in North America, its biggest market, jumped 18.3% to $44.12 billion.
Revenue in its Amazon Web Services cloud business surged 45.3% to $7.43 billion to beat estimate of $7.26 billion. Competitor Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported Wednesday that revenue in its cloud-computing business Azure rose 76% in its latest quarter.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), up 0.14%, had a market capitalization of $1.069 trillion, overtaking Microsoft's market cap of $1.068 trillion. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was up 0.15%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the world's most valuable company until the fourth-quarter 2018 slump knocked its stock price down 30% amid worries about slumping sales of its iPhone, by far its biggest revenue source.
The shares are up 50% this year, thanks to big gains in the first and third quarters and a 5.7% gain so far this month.

Slack shares were down 9.7% at $20.86 at 2 p.m. ET (19:00 GMT).
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares, meanwhile, rose 0.3% after the software giant said its workplace communication software platform, Teams, saw daily active users (DAUs) jump 54% to 20 million in October from 13 million in July.
Slack, meanwhile, last month said it grew its DAU by 37% in a year. 
Underscoring the threat from Microsoft's Teams, Wall Street has, in recent weeks, opted for caution.
Just last week, MKM Partners cut its price target on Slack to $28 from $38, citing competitive pressures from Teams.
Wedbush, meanwhile, appears far less sanguine on the messaging platform, with a price target of $14 amid worries that Teams represents a ""major hurdle"" to Slack's future growth prospects.
Slack went public in June to much fanfare as it rallied 50% above its IPO price of $26, though the rally had raised valuation concerns. But shares have slumped pretty much consistently since the IPO and are now 26% below their IPO price.
The Wall Street Journal has also weighed in on the debate, warning earlier this year that shares of Slack were running too hot as there was little evidence that companies were adopting the messaging platform exclusively.
Slack in September reported second-quarter results that topped estimates, but its forecast for a slightly larger-than-expected loss for the third quarter stoked fears about its growth.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bonds-surge-amid-speculation-of-fed-rate-cuts-us-economy-grows-52-3246213,"Nov 29, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - Global bond markets are rallying, marking November as the best month since 2008, buoyed by growing optimism that the Federal Reserve might start easing interest rates in the first half of 2024. This surge in bond markets was catalyzed by recent U.S. economic data supporting a 'Goldilocks scenario', where growth is just right – neither too hot nor too cold. Notably, two-year Treasury yields fell to 4.65%, while Fed swaps now anticipate a quarter-point rate cut by May. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 exhibits signs of reaching ""overbought"" levels, with mixed performances among key players such as  Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). Oil prices are also on the rise, anticipating the outcomes of the upcoming OPEC+ meeting.
The U.S. economy showed remarkable growth in the third quarter, recording its fastest expansion in about two years. However, consumer spending saw a slower increase, attributed to reduced services spending. Contrasting with this robust GDP growth, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, the personal consumption expenditures price index, was revised lower. The Beige Book report from the Fed indicated a slowdown in economic activity, as consumer discretionary spending wanes.
The bond market's November rally reflects speculation that the Fed's aggressive rate hikes may be nearing an end. This scenario is supported by several Federal Reserve officials, including Cleveland President Loretta Mester and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic, suggesting a pause or potential cut in rates. Despite these indicators, the U.S. economy remains robust, as highlighted by economist Neil Dutta, who sees a ""soft-landing nirvana"" for equity market investors and a potential for bull steepening in the yield curve for bond investors.
In summary, the bond market's strong performance, combined with economic data and Fed officials' comments, points to a potentially favorable period for investors. However, the juxtaposition of a robust GDP against a backdrop of slowing consumer spending and revised inflation metrics presents a complex picture. The anticipated Fed pivot and the upcoming decisions of OPEC+ are key factors that will continue to shape market dynamics in the near term.

Rob Enslin: Thank you, Kelsey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our third quarter results underscore the compelling value our end-to-end automation platform delivers for our customers and the strength of our business model. For the quarter, ARR grew 24% to $1.378 billion, driven by a third quarter net new ARR of $70 million, while revenue was $326 million, up 24%. We continue to deliver growth while driving operational efficiencies across the organization. Non-GAAP operating margin increased more than 600 basis points year-over-year to 13%. We also delivered non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $44 million. As many of you know, at the beginning of this fiscal year we pivoted our go-to-market resources towards organizations that have a meaningful runway to invest in enterprise automation over the long-term. This investment has significantly increased our presence in the C-suite and helped raise our profile with partners of all sizes. You could feel our momentum at Forward VI, our annual user conference, where we hosted more than 3,000 guests, including automation practitioners, industry visionaries, and key customer decision makers. We also launched our inaugural UiPath AI10 Awards program, recognizing UiPath customers who embody what it means to be a leader in AI at Work. I left the event super energized about the tangible value our platform is delivering for customers and our leadership position in the market. FX-adjusted dollar based net retention for the quarter was 123% and we closed a record number of third quarter deals over $1 million in ARR. Customers with $1 million or more in ARR grew 31% to 264, while customers with $100,000 or more in ARR increased to 1,974. Industry verticalization continues to be a strategic priority for the company with playbooks, marketing events and enablement to support our teams. We now have 70 solution accelerators available in our marketplace, with IT Service Management Software user provisioning and two-way match invoice processing for Coupa and SAP among some of the most popular downloads. While we saw broad based strength in net new ARR across industries this quarter, there were a couple of standouts. The Federal team delivered a record quarter as agencies are increasingly standardizing on our AI-powered Business Automation Platform with a robust set of end-to-end capabilities to enrich employee experience, create mission readiness, and achieve breakthrough outcomes. Customer highlights included Veterans Affairs, Coast Guard, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security. We are also working with the United States Department of Agriculture to support their Future of Work initiative, delivering a new era of citizen and employee experiences. Using our full platform, USDA is driving mission impactful enterprise automations across their HR, Finance, and IT departments. The program also features a digital assistant on every USDA employee desktop, driving personal productivity for approximately 100,000 employees. Momentum continues in financial services and health care where automation delivers considerable value. This includes one of our top 25 customers, a large non-profit health system in the United States. Taking a deeper look at their automation journey, they are a great example of how customers expand with us over time. Working closely with our account executives and global systems integrators, their journey started in 2018 with core RPA and, over the last several years, they have expanded to attended automation, Document Understanding, Test Suite, and Process Mining. To date, they have achieved a return on investment of over $250 million and this quarter, in one of our largest deals in company history, they expanded to the full platform as they work to create a centralized Enterprise Automation Service department with a mandate from their EVP sponsor to deliver automation across their entire enterprise. They are also in the process of developing use cases for Communications Mining and UiPath Apps. Customers standardize on our AI-powered Automation Platform to deliver transformational outcomes that streamline processes, eliminate errors, and operate with the enterprise-quality execution needed to succeed in today's environment. A great example is  Johnson Controls  (NYSE:JCI). After starting their automation journey in 2021 with core RPA, they adopted the full UiPath platform as they work to consolidate the automation program to one end-to-end solution. They also plan to leverage our AI capabilities like Document Understanding, Test Suite, and Task Mining to drive automation across their entire business. Another example is The Department for Work and Pensions, the United Kingdom's largest public service department. They have been using core RPA since 2018 to help their most vulnerable citizens improve their quality of life by automating millions of service and support claims each year. Since their first deployment, they have scaled to over 1,000 robots in production and saved 3.1 million hours to date. During the quarter they expanded to the full platform as they look to harness AI and integrate Document Understanding, Process Mining, and Communications Mining into their automation program to improve citizen services, drive operational efficiency, and increase cost saving and capacity creation. We are also landing new logos which are adopting multiple platform products in their first purchase like Tenable and KIK Consumer Products. In their first phase of deployment KIK intends to leverage unattended robots and Document Understanding to drive efficiency across their finance department, with the long-term goal of scaling automation across the entire enterprise. Our value-based go-to-market tool, NorthStar, also continues to drive deeper customer conversations as we strategically position the differentiated and actionable benefits of AI-powered automation. A great example is Sobeys, a customer since 2020, where we created a NorthStar roadmap to help them maximize the return on investment of their automation program. And as a result, Sobeys expanded the automation footprint in the quarter to streamline processes in finance, merchandising, and supply chain and to improve their hiring process in stores. They are also investigating how they may be able to use our platform in their SAP transformation journey. Turning to our SAP partnership, while in the early stages, we are excited about the collaboration between our teams. I recently joined Scott Russell, SAP Executive Board Member, Customer Success, to co-host their sales leadership meeting and we continue to see success in signing new logos from this partnership. Key one for me The Arnott’s Group, [indiscernible] in Australia, an Australian legend, the Australian producer of biscuits and snack food, The Arnott’s Group selected the UiPath Platform to optimize business processes and reduce operating costs. Their initial focus will be on automating end-to-end sales order and invoice processing. We also announced an expanded partnership with Deloitte, one of SAP's largest and most strategic partners. Deloitte will embed the UiPath AI-powered Business Automation Platform into their Ascend service delivery platform, powering the next generation of SAP transformations. These strategic relationships are powerful for our customers, but they also drive increased engagement with GSIs, and our partner ecosystem, that has never been more invested in than they are right now. At Forward VI, we hosted an impactful session for more than 750 partners outlining our streamlined strategy that is designed to accelerate growth and revenue for our partners, while creating solutions that deliver exceptional value to our customers. Our partners and GSIs are an important element of our go-to-market motion that help us expand our reach to customers in a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective way. For example, working with Deloitte, an Australian Government agency has built a robust automation program across their finance and HR business lines where they utilize Document Understanding to streamline invoice processing, reduce errors, and enhance data accuracy. To further accelerate their automation program, they adopted Task Mining in the quarter to analyze processes and accelerate scoping activities. Broadening our technology ecosystem also makes it easier for customers to deploy automations. We recently announced several new strategic partnerships. These include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Bedrock, which enables automation developers and citizen developers to seamlessly integrate Generative AI directly into their UiPath Studio and Studio Web automations, and the availability of the AI-Powered Business Automation Platform on the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Marketplace in early 2024. In summary, third quarter results are another proof point of our commitment to delivering strong top line growth with expanding profitability and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow. I want to thank our employees and partners for their support. None of this would be possible without your relentless focus on unlocking value for our customers day in and day out. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Daniel.
Daniel Dines: Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon everyone, thanks for joining us. The automation market is at an inflection point, and as the market leading tool that enables organizations to derive actionable value from AI, we believe this is a huge opportunity for UiPath. At Forward VI we introduced our latest platform release, 2023.10, and delivered scores of new capabilities that seamlessly translate the potential of AI into tangible action to drive business outcomes for our customers. From my perspective one of the most exciting announcements at Forward was UiPath Autopilot, a new set of AI-powered capabilities for developers, testers, analysts, and knowledge workers, designed to enhance the user experience across the UiPath platform. We expect Autopilot, which is based on Generative AI, to bring our unique capabilities in RPA, API automation, Document Understanding, and Specialized AI to the full spectrum of enterprise-grade end-to-end processes automation. Autopilot for Studio is intended to help developers across skill levels build automations faster by leveraging natural language descriptions to generate automation workflows. For less technical developers this is a great starter tool, while an advanced developer will benefit from increased productivity. Autopilot for Test will accelerate every phase of the testing lifecycle from generation of tests to surfacing insights from test results. And, finally, as the AI companion for business users, we anticipate that Autopilot for Everyone will help users create and use personalized and intelligent micro automations on the fly. We also shared exciting announcements around Intelligent Document Processing at Forward, introducing our next-generation experience powered by active learning and Generative AI. Our next-gen IDP permits almost anyone to train Specialized AI models for specific domains and document types, and our internal benchmarking shows that our next-gen IDP experience accelerates model training time by up to 80% from a week to a day for complex scenarios, or down to minutes for simpler forms. Document Understanding is driving significant value for customers including a Chicago based public utility. Working with Deloitte, they have created a robust automation program across their organization leveraging our AI products like Document Understanding to automate their meter inspection process where they have achieved over $12 million and 163,000 hours in savings to date. With c-level sponsorship, during the quarter they expanded their UiPath deployment to incorporate Test Suite into their automation journey with a goal of saving over $70 million a year. And, we are humbled by third-party recognition of our achievements, including IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Intelligent Document Processing or IDP, 2023-2024 Vendor Assessment where UiPath was named a leader in IDP for our broad market leadership and robust IDP capabilities in UiPath Document Understanding and Communications Mining integrated into our broader enterprise automation platform. Innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy and we challenge ourselves every day to deliver market leading capabilities with a customer first mindset. I spent a lot of time with our teams in both Bellevue and Romania this quarter and am energized by our cutting edge product roadmap focused on transforming enterprise automation by harnessing the next-generation of AI technologies. Together with our world-class team of engineers I am excited to dedicate more time driving UiPath's innovation agenda as I transition into my new Chief Innovation Officer role this winter. With that, I will turn it over to Ashim.
Ashim Gupta: Thank you, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis and all growth rates are year-over-year. Turning to the third quarter, ARR totaled $1.378 billion, an increase of 24%, driven by net new ARR of $70 million. Excluding the FX tailwind, net new ARR totaled $69 million. We ended the quarter with 10,865 customers, including new logos like New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), Smile Doctors, Beacon Health System, and MidWestOne Financial Group. As we said last quarter, we continue to see macro headwinds at the lower end of our market and remain focused on acquiring customers with a higher propensity to grow. Our dollar-based net retention rate for the third quarter was 121%. Normalizing for FX, dollar-based net retention rate was 123%. Dollar-based gross retention of 97% continues to be best-in-class. Revenue grew to $326 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Normalizing for FX, which was an approximately $3 million tailwind, revenue grew 23%. Remaining performance obligations increased to $995 million, up 31% year-over-year. Normalizing for FX, which was an approximately $16 million tailwind, RPO grew 29%. Current RPO increased to $599 million. Turning to expenses. We delivered a third quarter overall gross margin of 87%, and software gross margin was 92%. As the team continues to drive cost discipline, we now expect fiscal year 2024 gross margins to be approximately 86%. Third quarter operating expenses were $240 million, highlighting the leverage in our business and our commitment to expense management and operating discipline. GAAP operating loss of $56 million included $96 million of stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating income was $44 million, resulting in a third quarter non-GAAP operating margin of 13%. Third quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $44 million. As of October 31, we had $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and no debt. Under our $500 million buyback program, which we announced on September 6th, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $16.26 through October 31. Since November 1, under a 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares at an average price of $17.38 through November 28, 2023. Now, let me turn to guidance, which assumes the global macroeconomic environment continues to be variable. For the fiscal fourth quarter 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $381 million to $386 million. ARR in the range of $1.450 billion to $1.455 billion. Non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $78 million. And, we expect fourth quarter basic share count to be approximately 567 million shares. And, finally, we expect fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of more than $250 million. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with many of you during the quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to the Operator. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. [Indiscernible] on for Keith Weiss. Maybe to start off, quick question on sort of AI and how you see it fit into the current budget environment. Clearly, budget growth is still somewhat suppressed. And you're one of the few companies that’s sort of uniquely positioned between traditional automation and generative AI technologies. Where do you see customers kind of take the dollars from when they're spending on these AI technologies, whether that's within the product areas that you offer? Or more broadly, anything that's kind of coming out of your customer conversations in terms of how spend is getting reallocated that of AI?
Rob Enslin: Yes, good question. What I would say is that when customers are looking at spending with us and the AI, the AI story and AI, connection, AI to automation connection really fits well to where customers want to invest. And in many cases, the investments are coming out of the business case and business value that we produced in NorthStar and are able to show the efficiencies in how to gain so they can invest in innovation. And they see us as an innovation leader today with AI and innovation, combined with our AI powered platform. So I don't feel like it's been taken away for one group to another, I feel it's really driven by the business case, we are able to drive with C-level suite and now we focus on industry solutions. And now we've connected those to the buying cycle with customers.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful. And then a quick question on the margin side. It looks like sales and marketing expenses stepped up pretty markedly on a sequential basis. Obviously, you also do forward contracts in the quarter, but anything that you can highlight in terms of where you're investing, are you back to kind of growing your sales force more markedly and the second will continue into next year. Anything that you can share, there will be great.
Rob Enslin: I would just highlight two points. First is, we are going to continue to invest in our sales team, especially in our sales capacity, especially as we head into next year. And then the second is if you recall, we also are dealing with -- we also have the reallocation of our software expenses. So first through third quarter, you'll see sales and marketing versus G&A, a little bit lopsided, and which will be caught up in fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Murphy: Thank you so much, and I will add my congrats. So Rob, thinking back to the Analyst Day just over a year ago, you had mentioned there that every tech company, of course has shelfware and that UiPath does as well. If you think about it about a year later, do you sense that customers have worked down any excess inventory they might have had in terms of bots, maybe hitting a level where they might need to replenish and just start moving forward a bit faster as we get into next year? And then have a quick follow-up.
Rob Enslin: Yes, Mark, look as I said earlier on, companies deal with shelfware, we feel good that our platform actually helps us move customers from not only bots into the broader platform as a focus on efficiencies, this marketplace that we're dealing with today. Certainly benefits efficiencies in new business model, so we feel really good that we are able to take customers to the next level with our platform and our C level activity.
Mark Murphy: Okay. And Ashim, when we look at it arithmetically, the deceleration in ARR has been moderating, which of course is great to see. It looks like it could step down a bit, a bit closer to 20% next quarter. But is it possible to entertain the thought of holding -- kind of holding a level around 20% for a period of time? Or do you think we should kind of keep that trending down into the teens? As we've had it just -- try to be mindful of the law of large numbers and some of the some of the macro unknowns that are out there.
Ashim Gupta: Yes, I would just say, Mark, we're really pleased with our performance and the team's execution. We are focused on closing out a good year-end here. And the teams are really focused on that. And we look at our fourth quarter guidance just putting the right prudence and the right macroeconomic variability included in our guidance, and we'll update as we get closer to next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Chirag Ved: Hi, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a very strong quarter. This is Chirag on for Kirk. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that large deals landed extremely strong. Do you have any additional commentary around what you're seeing with these large deals in terms of both new logos and renewals? And how you expect this trend to continue looking ahead to next quarter and next year? Essentially, all in all, do you believe that we're close to a more stabilized macro and spending environment? Or are you still seeing some broader choppiness out there? Thank you.
Rob Enslin: Yes, I mean, we -- look, we feel really good about how our teams are adopting all the changes that we've made and how they're connecting with customers and the relationships we're having with customers. The expansion has really, in many ways driven through our growth products with all the AI communication that's happening in the market, it allows us to have meaningful conversations with customers, they see why the platform is relevant. And then we as I said, early on, we've been driving NorthStar quite a bit and showing where customers can really look at processes and tasks and understand how to drive value with the automation platform. So folks talk about digital transformation and connect, we believe that AI powered automation is really helping digital transformation with our customer base and our larger customers. And we're pretty happy with some of the net new companies that we've acquired over the last -- the quality of them, you really look at these kind of -- these are good companies that will expand with us over time if we do the right stuff. And so we feel good about that, we feel good about how our industry focuses is helping us change the game in this environment.
Chirag Ved: All right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Sills: Oh, great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around some of the departmental expansions you've seen. You talked about industries here. I think banking and public sector sounded good. But are you finding that you're seeing now with the uplift in expansion activity here with NRR, that you're getting outside of finance and accounting into IT, HR, some of these other use cases in the departments?
Rob Enslin: Yes, so I would say we have broad machine broad industry activity, with manufacturing, with retail, with fashion retail with grocery hard goods retail. As we said, we feel really positive about public sector, and public sector globally. And we also see a significant amount of activity outside of the finance offers in procurement and in IT organization. So it's much more broad based. And we feel really good about where we are focused on that.
Brad Sills: Great. And then one of the forward conference, if I could please. If you could just remind us how important that event is for lead management and moving deals through the pipeline. And how do you feel coming out of the conference this year versus years past in terms of momentum? Thank you.
Rob Enslin: Brad, I’ve only got 2 years experience. And what I would tell you, I was super excited to see the quality of customers and the quality of the event and the quality of the discussions that we had. If you look at the companies we have on stage with us and what they were doing with us, these are really transformational. If you look at the partners, partnerships with SAP and Deloitte [indiscernible] this was transformation. We spoke about 750 partners that were aligning around the channel strategy. So we feel good that we actually -- forward is actually a catalyst event to move UiPath, helped our branding, position us in the C-suite and make a difference and it certainly does help our pipeline as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Raimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Firstly, a more bigger picture question, like if you think about the different areas of strengths that you saw this quarter, like can you specifically speak a little bit about what you saw on test, Rob? Because that's what we hear from our [indiscernible] as one of the areas where especially in the SAP ecosystem, there seems to be a lot going on there and not quite sure you're getting enough credit. And then I had a follow-up for Ashim, please.
Rob Enslin: Yes, it's -- so if I look at the broader picture, you look at -- if you look at the market today, as I said early on customers are looking for ways to drive efficiencies to fund other activity. And there's not a significant amount of new business models that are driving growth. So that really helps us significantly, and obviously their [indiscernible] where SAP of focus where their transformation objectives, the [indiscernible] program, which is an ongoing program. And it's -- I believe that we've actually moved the needle significantly with SAP. With the SAP activity between the different sales organizations and we are involved in many transformation discussions with SAP and our GSA partners -- GSI partners, and we will see more that test is a key part of that, because it has an incredible value proposition which allows customers to drive not only -- not necessarily savings, but time benefits. And really automation of testing is one of the biggest challenges customers have in a big SAP environment. And we feel we do an excellent job helping customers achieve significant test results, which obviously, help mitigate any risk associated with a go live.
Raimo Lenschow: Yes, okay, perfect. Then, one for Ashim. As you think about like it does look like the demand trends are stable, and we kind of could potentially look for better times ahead. Obviously, you have the best net ARR addition for a few quarters now as well. How do you and you guys -- but also you guys have been very disciplined around cost and margins, but at some point, you need to think about lead times for sales people, et cetera. How do you think about that balance of like getting ready for eventually better times versus where you are at the moment? What are you seeing in terms of productivity gains, proceeds, et cetera, for example, to kind of drive this going forward? Thank you.
Rob Enslin: I mean, I would start with we have a very powerful business model, Raimo, strong gross margins that allows us to invest while still generate cash and margins. And so we have been investing, whether that is within our product team as well as our sales team. I mentioned earlier, we're investing in our frontline sales team and our sales capacity. And we'll continue to invest in areas where we see the right returns and the right investments. And Rob and the team looks at that on an ongoing basis, and we do as a leadership team. At the same time, we also are looking for efficiencies. So together with that I think we're constantly in investment mode we feel very positive about our value offering and we feel like we can both drive that investment while still generate cash and margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist. Please proceed with your question.
Terry Tillman: Yes, congrats from me on the quarterly results, first of all. I guess, Rob, maybe the first question is, maybe I'm pretty simple here. But NorthStar roadmaps seem like a no brainer, like how much of your customer base [indiscernible] your larger enterprises. Have you actually unleashed the NorthStar roadmaps on? And the second part of my first question is, I'm hearing a lot from you about full platform adoption. Have you done anything with product or packaging to create less inertia to move all in with the platform and then add a follow-up for Ashim.
Rob Enslin: Sure. Great questions. So I would say, we are doing a lot around pricing and packaging, and obviously pricing, packaging and solutions. And it's a constant upgrade, I would say of that. But you got to be very careful about how you actually bring that into the market. And we're focused on really simplifying SKUs and so making it very simple for customers to purchase. And also make it simple for customers to mix and match solution sets with AI units or bots in a way that's very simple, so that they can actually expand with less friction and we are doing significantly more of that. NorthStar is a combination of a great value based tool that has to be connected to the C-suite. You have to have sellers that are able to communicate and as we enable our organization more and we get more references, we are able to scale more and continue to scale the organization, so there's still plenty opportunity for us to continue driving that and continue to work on NorthStar with organizations.
Terry Tillman: That's great. Thank you for that, Rob. And I guess, Ashim, in terms of all the work on the go-to-market side this year, is there potentially a further drift in NRR? Could it actually improve from here? I mean, it's already best-in-class. I'm just kind of curious how you could see NRR trends potentially with more of the harvesting of all this work on the go-to-market side. Thank you.
Ashim Gupta: I just say we continue to be pleased with where we are and how we're executing and we're going to look forward to closing out fourth quarter and we'll provide more updates next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer. Please proceed -- with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.
Fred Havemeyer: Hey, thank you very much. And I'd also like to congratulate you on a very strong quarter. I wanted to focus once again on generative AI. But firstly, looking at your product to see it being integrated throughout your portfolio and your suite, I'm looking forward to [indiscernible] what you can do there. But I wanted to take a, I guess a bigger picture, look at the longer term outlook of the market considering some of the impressive results [indiscernible] autonomous agents using for example, like GPT, for blending vision texts, et cetera. I'm curious, considering that UiPath has recently been one of the original autonomous agent companies with your attended and unattended RPA, how do you think about the market evolution over time with [indiscernible] or agents like functionality being built using generative AI now?
Daniel Dines: Well, I think that direction in the market that we are seeing right now, around autonomous agents prove a bit -- our approach that always said that AI plus automation is the thing that drives the biggest outcomes for our customers. Actually, this is what we are seeing a lot of our customers after the initial, a little bit of a pause around how AI is going to help me with my automation, they realize that they need powerful automation platform in order to harvest the power of AI. And going forward on a longer term basis with UiPath are in one of the best positions to build the next generation foundational models that understand processes, tasks, screens and documents, the type of multimodal that is built in, in order to drive automation. So it's -- to me, it's clear that the world is going into that direction. And again, we are really in a very good position to take advantage of it.
Rob Enslin: Thank you for that. I'm looking forward to having an intern as a service to be able to help out autonomously and everything. I hope also just related to the topic here of generative AI, I’ve consistently heard feedback about the difficulty of organizing one's own data within an enterprise in a way that's useful. And so I'm curious what you're hearing from your customers about how they're beginning to and attempting to approach their own generative AI strategies and whether UiPath's automation platform is really able to help customers more holistically across the board with generative AI.
Daniel Dines: Yes, actually, this is one of the major use cases where automation is used right now in order to fine train customer [indiscernible] were even specialized AI. And it's frankly one of the hot discussion points with our partners around the world. We had interesting discussions in Japan and in the U.S with companies like Accenture (NYSE:ACN), were Deloitte that are very interested in to how they can leverage automation to cleanse the data and to accelerate custom training of [indiscernible] and specialized AI.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Siti Panigrahi: Thank you. So it's good to see this net new ARR bounce back. So are you speak with your customer? What do you think the enterprise spending train would be next year in terms of priority for automation spending?
Rob Enslin: Yes, I mean, we've done -- we've looked at different analysts, different markets and many analysts will tell you that they see cloud or [indiscernible] data and cyber and automation is the key trends in terms of spending next year. But I would caution and say, customers are, as I said early on are very thoughtful in how they want to spend, where they want to spend and where -- how they're going to fund it, which benefits us and benefits us in the way that we actually approach customers. I don't see a significant change in that spending. I do think that customers are going to look to see how AI and AI automation and Gen AI can help them drive more efficiency and deeper levels of efficiency in the organization and look at different models when it comes to customers and our customers, how they communicate with customers, how they drive customer journeys as well. And we are focused on helping our customers with that approach in a deep way. Also connecting meaningful inputs and outputs in companies around documents and social communication emails into this process in order to drive real process orchestration at a different level.
Siti Panigrahi: Thank you. And, Ashim, a follow-up. If I capture your total customer count, it seems like it does come down this quarter. But you guys also had a pretty good -- on your enterprise segment spending. So wondering like, was there anything different you saw in different segments, like small versus mid to large segment?
Ashim Gupta: Yes, look, we're very pleased with how our enterprise segment is performing. The macroeconomic variability that we've talked about has had more pronounced impact on the lower end of the market with smaller businesses. And that's where we see the majority of our churned customers, which Rob mentioned also earlier. Overall, I think our strategy remains consistent. We're focused on the quality of customers. And we define quality as customers with a high propensity to buy and we liked the way the teams are executing against that strategy.
Siti Panigrahi: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Turits: Hey, guys, congrats on solid execution. So two questions. One, where are we in terms of the shortening of the deployment time for the average bot? It seems like it has already improved and does the rollout of autopilot help shorten that time even further? And then have a follow-up for Ashim on [indiscernible]. Thanks.
Daniel Dines: This is always one of our major product focus on how can we shorten the adoption curve for our customers. And we are already seeing with our autopilot family that is in private preview some really good results with the initial set of few hundreds of customers that are testing the product. So, yes, I would say that this is going to be a significant driver for adoption. And both for advanced developers, where they will get to really increase the productivity to also citizen developers that will get started faster. And also, I would like to mention that training our specialized Document Understanding and Communication Mining models using Gen AI, it has already proven this is actually in production already. And it's been proven to accelerate the deployment quite a bit.
Michael Turits: Thanks, Daniel. And then, Ashim, on the NRR, it's great to see it having stabilized on an as reported basis. But could you go down another two points, as it did last quarter on an FX adjusted basis. So what are the puts and takes there? You're actually getting slightly easier comps. So what -- what's pulling that down at this point? And what are the things that are working in trying to actually increase in NRR?
Rob Enslin: Yes, I mean, I look at our dollar base net retention adjusted for FX, it's 123%, which in our scale we're very pleased with and continues to be in the best-in-class territory. There always be a little bit of large numbers. And of course, every quarter's deal mix will change. But overall, we're really pleased with the strategy. I think we've had several marquee deals in the quarter. The penetration and the sale of the platform as Rob mentioned, we're making -- we continue to make really good progress on and we see very good strong performance in the enterprise segment, particularly in North America. A lot of the -- whatever headwinds we do see, we see really pronounced in the more pronounced in the lower end of the market. But overall our strategy is on customers with a higher propensity to buy. We feel like we are executing against that strategy and we're seeing that results in the deal quality and the customer quality though -- the end -- the customer quality in the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Berg: Hi, everyone. Nice quarter here. Thanks for taking my questions. Your net new ARR was up year-over-year for the first time, I believe since fourth quarter fiscal '22. So nice change there on the positive side. I think most of the questions have been on your execution within the quarter and have a commentary from the demand end of the market. Are you seeing any changes around your customers or the environment more mid market enterprise? Because you mentioned the down market a couple different times in the macro impact there. But are you seeing any sort of positive change upward in demand from whether it's existing customers or [indiscernible]?
Rob Enslin: Yes, I mean, I do definitely see positive demand, positive conversations in the market. We feel like we have a significant seat at the table with the AI, open AI, chat GBT kind of discussion that's been taking place. And plus, having the platform has allowed us to have C level, sea level conversations. We have customers now that are really calling us to actually have discussions with. They've been using Core RPA since 2018, 2019 and they feel like there's an opportunity to expand it. They're not getting hold of that. They're not getting as much value as they believe they could get out of it. And those conversations are taking place. And we're able to actually showcase proof points on how to do this. So that -- yes, definitely more positive and definitely feel good about the discussion of how we can help customers and how we are more relevant to the business discussion.
Scott Berg: Got it. Helpful. And then, Ashim, your current RPO metrics growth rate accelerated pretty meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. Was there any one-time anomalies? I don't know, early renewals or something that impacted that abnormally in the quarter? Was that a pretty clean calculation metric? Thank you.
Ashim Gupta: No, major abnormalities like early renewals, et cetera. I think I've mentioned we had several marquee deals in the quarter and record number of deals above a $1 million for the third quarter. So it's just its execution and really good deal quality that's driving that metric.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Turrin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two part, I'll just ask up front. Rob, given investments you mentioned in reaching the C-suite, wondering if you can provide us with your perspective around how enterprise customers are approaching IT budget growth into next year and automation as a part of that. And then, as a second part for, Ashim, can you comment on the visibility you have into 4Q forecast currently and any swing factors for us to consider in terms of potential upside there? Thank you.
Rob Enslin: Yes, Michael, I'll take it now, let Ashim go later. Because we are having these conversations in the boardroom, customer -- customer conversations much wide to C level suite. We are much earlier in the budget cycles than we previously been. And we are actually much more important in the budget cycle than I believe we've been previously. I think there's a couple of really key points that stand out right our industry. How we've driven industry and how we made ourselves relevant in particular industries and the value proposition there. I do believe that the global systems integrators and how they've come along and support of us, the messaging around SAP has driven while and the platform proof points around, DEU and announced the customer that are $250 million savings in my earning script. This is what's really allowing us to participate. And so we feel like we are meaningful part of where the budgets are going next year. I think everybody is looking at how tight their budgets are, and trying to find out how to move from one pocket to another pocket on the innovation side. And we are definitely on the innovation side of customers thinking and then I'll hand it over to Ashim.
Ashim Gupta: Yes, so just in terms of our guidance, we've factored in the macroeconomic variability that we've talked about, and it includes the current view of our deal mix. And we look at just executing -- the teams are focused on executing a good end to year-end, close to the year, and that's what we're focused on. That's what I've [indiscernible] on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Jared Levine: Thanks. It's actually Jared on for Bryan today. In terms of the competitive environment any changes from what you're seeing from Microsoft ServiceNow or Automation Anywhere?
Rob Enslin: Yes. I have a look at -- if I look at ServiceNow, we don't see them in many opportunities. What I will tell you, our service, our connectors, the one of the most, it is the most popular downloaded connected to UiPath and we continue to partner with them. And our partnership with Microsoft around co-pilot and [indiscernible] pilot, the discussions we're having with them continues to be robust. And we are very happy with where we going with Microsoft, and that partnership. And as for a lot of the traditional RPA vendors, I feel that we are now -- we've broadened our skill sets and what we are offering we don't see them that often anymore.
Jared Levine: And then do you have any data points on how the new bundled pricing packages is increasing revenue, uplift per client or anything around revenue uplift from the reduction of SKUs as part of the sales refresh?
Rob Enslin: I don’t have specific that we can point to now. I mean, we are looking at the results is probably a little bit too early for us to kind of come out with where we are on that. But we do feel good that early signs of, I would just simply say, easier for customers to understand, easier for them to move. Definitely -- they definitely like how they're able to use AI units across multiple products and interchange them as they think of new use cases to advance their business as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Ethan Bruck: Hey, guys, this is Ethan Bruck on for Alex Zukin and thanks for taking question and congrats on the nice results. I guess, Rob, this one might be for you. If we were to like unpack a little bit and like more color, there's some stuff you saw in the quarter in terms of just either like certain verticals where we saw -- I know you mentioned on like the variable demand, but just kind of comparing from the macro, maybe by vertical basis, if something's got improved, or were more steady versus the last few quarters you've seen, and then just a bit on renewal behavior in terms of what it's like more -- buying more licenses, more [indiscernible] just kind of how was the kind of renewal conversation in 3Q compared to what you saw at the beginning of the year?
Rob Enslin: Yes. Look, the last quarter was a very strong quarter for public sector for our federal business actually in the U.K., and in the United States. And that was really because the Federal businesses are looking at the platform in a unique way, and we offer some really incredible capabilities around Document Understanding, connecting that to attended automation, focusing on how citizens can improve their [indiscernible]. So we've seen us our -- our market move in public sector, that also is based on talent, the talent we bought into that environment and how we've driven that talent. And now we actually have some really good industry-based activity in public sector, in revenue services, in DoD, in customs, in USDA, that actually can really help all of our public sector activity globally. When you look at traditional markets, like when you look at traditional -- more traditional markets, telcos, CPG companies, manufacturing, retail companies, they're all driving efficiencies and driving efficiencies in retail, it's how fast can open up stores? How fast can I get employees on? How do I make [indiscernible] my price points are valid, and my price points are real, and I don't have any price point issues between stores and so on. And actually automation really drives some significantly capabilities in that we play a significant role. If you look at capital intensive telcos, it's all about efficiencies, and how can I get competitive advantage efficiencies because my markets are mature. And the only way I actually get growth is by competing my competition and moving subscribers from one provider to another provider. And in that space, we're playing pretty well. So it's variable in which industries you're in, it's variable in terms of how they see growth and where they are investing. But there's one common theme across the board and that's efficiencies. With renewals, it gives us an opportunity to drive a platform, to drive the platform earlier, to actually start having the discussions with customers most -- many months or many quarters earlier in terms of why move to the platform. Here's the value. Let's work on NorthStar with you. Let's get in the office. We've got an SAP transformation. We can help you with that as well. Let us bring one of our big global [indiscernible] showcase the transformation. And that really helps drive a different cadence with renewals. It's not just about renewing what you've already got, it's about renewing what you want to do in the future and how you want to add more business value in the future. And I think we're incredibly good at that right now.
Ethan Bruck: That's super clear. And then just, Ashim, as a quick one for you, the incremental margins in the quarter, they're really good. They've been really good all year. I guess just, if you remind us just some of the puts and takes we should keep in mind around how to think about the margin profile kind of the in the out years? Thanks again.
Ashim Gupta: Look, we -- I would refer you back to our Investor Day pitch [ph] last year, where we talked about long-term operating -- just our long-term operating model there. We're really pleased with the execution on the margin front. We've been ahead of that curve in terms of just execution. And we feel really good about our ability to operate with discipline and efficiency while still investing in growth for the company.
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Rob Enslin: Yes, I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you to all of you for all the support. It's great to have you all on the call today. Happy holidays to you and your family. May you enjoy a great time. [Indiscernible].
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Trey Campbell, Senior Vice President, Invest Relations. Please go ahead.
Trey Campbell: Thanks Lisa. Good afternoon everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chair and CEO of Synopsys; Sassine Ghazi, President and COO; and Shelagh Glaser, CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results are subject to many risks and uncertainties. That could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings press release, financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on our website at the conclusion of the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.
Aart de Geus: Good afternoon. In Q4, we exceeded the high end of all our guidance targets and delivered another quarterly revenue high at $1.599 billion. Q4 thus capped a record year, growing revenue by 15% to $5.84 billion, with strong orders expanding backlog by $1.5 billion to $8.6 billion. We further improved non-GAAP operating margin to 35.1%, increased non-GAAP EPS by 26%, generated $1.7 billion in operating cash flow while maintaining an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Clearly, Synopsys has moved forward with sustained momentum. Over the last five years, we've grown revenue at 13% CAGR, expanded non-GAAP operating margin by 13 points, and increased non-GAAP EPS at a 23% CAGR. Through the year, we also widened our differentiation by substantially expanding our AI-driven product capabilities, but also through unique collaborations that strengthened our customers' differentiation while cementing deep long-term relationships. We thank our employees for their passion and dedication, and our customers for their business and trust in Synopsys. Meanwhile, dark geopolitical clouds are inflicting unimaginable harm in multiple conflict zones. Our hearts hurt with deep compassion for our employees, families, colleagues, customers, and all others impacted by pain, loss, and uncertainty. Yet, we will never give up believing in the positive potential of humanity. It is thus heartwarming to see how fast our teams have turned compassion into caring, caring into action, and how respect and support for each other is an active norm at Synopsys. Let me now briefly share some thoughts on the state of the industry and our company before I pass the baton to Sassine. From the first days of Synopsys 37 years ago, Synopsys has enabled and navigated the exponential ambition that came to be defining the semiconductor industry and which in turn radically impacted the world. Our initial contribution, synthesis, revolutionized digital design. We ushered in the transition from CAD, Computer Aided Design, to EDA, Electronic Design Automation, so far delivering roughly a 10 million X increase in design productivity. During Synopsys' entire existence, the vast majority of our products have been the state-of-the-art. Together with the leading foundries, we thus empowered digital age exponential, referred to as Moore's Law. And then at the very moment that the economics of classic Moore's Law are slowing down in terms of transistor performance and cost improvements, the era of big data and AI becomes real, triggering enormous compute needs on the horizon. About eight years ago, Synopsys forecasted this age of smart everything would become the driver for the semiconductor growth to a trillion dollars in this decade. And here we are. This year's Generative AI advances and furious adoption clearly fulfill our vision. As Pervasive AI is now massively underway, the classic Moore's Law era in turn is morphing into the SysMoore era, systemic complexity but still with a Moore's Law exponential ambition. SysMoore is happening in front of our eyes by reinventing architectures not based on a single chip, but on multiple chips, tightly connected, or even stacked on top of each other with extreme proximity. These so-called software-defined multi-die architectures will enable massive increases in the number of transistors available. And again, Synopsys is at the heart of the heart of catalyzing exponential impact. Our investments in multi-die design, our massive collection of IP building blocks in many silicon technology, our prototyping and electronic digital twinning technology that lets customers run software before the hardware actually exists, are all essential enablers driving the new race into AI driven computation. Adding one more spark to our technical leadership, Synopsys also pioneered the use of DeepLearning.AI in chip design. Applied to optimization, verification, and test, production results are outstanding, and adoption is broad and rapid. Most recently, our announcement of exciting GenAI capabilities adds yet another angle to driving the state-of-the-art forward. If nothing else, my enthusiasm for both the CISMO opportunity and for our technology advances should give you a sense how Synopsys is on the move. Talking about on the move, we're also well on the way in our executive leadership transition. I have great confidence, expectations, and enthusiasm for Sassine Ghazi as our next CEO. Sassine, please give us your perspective, vision and ambition for Synopsys. The floor is all yours.
Sassine Ghazi: Thank you, Aart, for your pioneering work in our industry and for building Synopsys into one of the world's essential semiconductor ecosystem companies. I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to succeed you as CEO, building on our strong foundation and propelling Synopsys to the next wave of growth. Let's turn to market trends. Despite global macroeconomic uncertainty, our customers continue to prioritize R&D investments and chip design starts remain robust. We leave 2023 with $8.6 billion in non-cancellable backlog, and have a time-tested business model that balances dynamic growth with macro resiliency. We expect solid growth across our geographies in 2024. But our outlook reflects a continued challenging near-term growth environment in China. China is an adaptable and large market. However, given the combination of Entity List and technology restrictions and a weaker macroeconomic outlook, we believe more pragmatism in our 2024 China forecast is appropriate. Technology trends continue to create a rising tide for our business. Chief among those trends is a new era of AI driven productivity. AI is reshaping industries and providing breakthrough solutions for intractable challenges, like the 15% to 30% percent design resource shortage the semiconductor is facing this decade. We pioneered AI driven semiconductor design and are relentlessly advancing our AI capabilities so that we can drive step-up function improvement in our customers’ productivity and thus play a greater role in their success. Recently, at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Ignite conference, we announced a breakthrough Generative AI capability for accelerating chip design, Synopsys.ai Copilot. The new capability is the result of a strategic collaboration with Microsoft to integrate Azure service that brings the power of GenAI into one of the most complex engineering challenges, the design process for semiconductors. The integration of GenAI across Synopsys.ai provides chip designers with collaborative capabilities that offer expert tool guidance, generative capabilities to enable RTL and collateral creation, and fully autonomous capabilities for workflow creation from natural language. We're engaged with leading chip makers, including AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Microsoft, to deliver the value of GenAI across the Synopsys.ai full EDA stack from design, verification, test to manufacturing. We are at a very early stage of this new AI era, but our initial customer results are exceptional. AI is key to massively unlocking customer productivity, and we are increasing our investment to accelerate the Synopsys.ai roadmap. Beyond AI, we see multiple other secular tailwinds providing our design automation and Design IP business expanding growth opportunities. With the slowing of Moore's Law, increasingly, architecture and design automation are the main levers in delivering semiconductor PPA gains, even as insatiable use case demands push the frontiers of performance and performance per watt. Multi-die implementations are accelerating as our customers seek to optimize cost and yield for these large complex designs. And our customers who rely on our critical competencies from silicon to software, now require a systems level approach, both at the semiconductor device level with multi-die and in the electronic design, software bring-up, and software validation of full systems, like today's software defined cars. Our Design IP business also has strong wind in its sails. Applications crave ever faster ingest and throughput, resulting in faster protocol migrations and increasing IP content value per device. Customers are prioritizing scarce design resources to focus on their critical architectural differentiation and turning to us as an integral part of their chip design development teams for their foundation and interface IP needs. And now, all three leading edge foundries are making Synopsys the advanced node IP vendor of choice. They are partnering with us on a broad range of IP titles to minimize risk and accelerate silicon success. Our design automation and Design IP businesses have both leadership technology and market positions with industry trends playing to our strengths. We're increasing our investment in these segments to capture more of this growing TAM. We started our investments in software integrity with the acquisition of Coverity in 2014. Software security was a pain point for every company, and risk surfaces were expanding. Customers were searching for innovative approaches in quality and security testing to help reduce the risk of software failures and security breaches. And we developed the broadest portfolio to meet that need. Flash forward to today, our software integrity business has become the leader in application security testing with industry leading team delivering over $0.5 billion in trailing 12 months revenue at mid-teens non-GAAP operating margin. We are proud of the significant progress we've made over the last nine years and believe the future opportunity remains attractive. At the same time, we have compelling investment opportunities in design automation and Design IT with much higher expected growth and return profiles. Following our strategic portfolio review and in consultation with the company's Board of Directors, we have decided to explore strategic alternatives for the software integrity business. As part of this process, we're considering full range of strategic opportunities. We will provide an update after we conclude that process. Based on these market and technology trends and with high confidence in our business, here are our 2024 guidance targets. We expect 2024 revenue between $6.57 and $6.63 billion. We expect to deliver 37% non-GAAP operating margin, a 200 basis point improvement versus last year. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $13.33 and $13.41. Shelagh will discuss the financials in more detail. Now I'll share some segment highlights starting with design automation. This quarter, Synopsys.ai was selected by AspenCore to receive the World Electronics Achievement Award for EDA Software of the Year. We're proud of the recognition, but even more excited by the strong customer adoption for Synopsys.ai across the design flow. A major North American hyperscaler made a major commitment to use DSO.ai after demonstrating PPA and productivity benefits on consecutive HPC projects. In verification, we engaged with over 20 customers in Q4, demonstrating up to 10x faster turnaround time. While in test, we added eight new customer engagements with [KIOXIA] (ph) publicly highlighting more than 50% pattern reduction. Finally, we and TSMC announced that our analog migration flow through Synopsys.ai is enabled across TSMC's advanced process technologies. We are also seeing great results deploying Synopsys.ai internally with our IP teams. Internal IP teams are seeing 10x turnaround time improvements in time to target verification coverage and have deployed analog design migration flows for TSMC 2 nanometer. Fusion Compiler continues to win key designs including the leading edge Arm mobile core for the industry's first implementation for a gate-all-around based mobile SoC. In combination with DSO.ai, Fusion Compiler also delivered 10% better power on gate-all-around based mobile GPU and modem designs. We saw continued momentum in sign-off, delivered by our leadership family of prime tools. We won multiple engagements with PrimeTime, PrimeClosure, and PrimeShield, and saw the world's top three data center providers adopt PrimeClosure to get the fastest ECO closure time for five 3-nanometer SoCs. Expanding our multi-die ecosystem, we received the prestigious leadership award from TSMC, OIP 2023 Partner of the Year, for developing the industry's first 3D IC design prototyping solution, supporting the new industry standard 3D blocks. Verification, product momentum also remains strong. This quarter, we announced our AI-driven next generation Verdi solution, which continues its lead in functional debug with deployment already at more than top semiconductor companies. In hardware assisted verification, we delivered another record year. In Q4, ZeBu won against competition at two large North American hyperscalers, and we expanded our HAPS footprint with a large North American systems company and a large Asian semiconductor company. Now turning to Design IP. This quarter, we won our first 2-nanometer interface IP engagement with a leading mobile company and are now in production at 3 nanometer with foundation IP for a high-volume PC chip. We delivered a key multi-die proof point in concert with Intel and TSMC on UCIe interoperability. The demonstration at Intel Innovation showed die-to-die interconnect over UCIe between Synopsys IP on TSMC and 3E and Intel Foundry Silicon. We saw two other key technology proof points this quarter. We demonstrated interoperability for our 224 gig Ethernet PHY IP and PCIe 6.0 IP, both industry firsts. On the processor IP side, we announced a new addition to the ARC processor IP portfolio, the RISC-V ARC-V processor IP. This product allows customers to choose from a broad range of flexible, extensible processor options that deliver optimal power performance efficiency for their target applications. Finally, we delivered a significant win in automotive, displacing competition at a marquee customer in a multi-generation, multiple project agreement. Now, to the software integrity segment, which delivered solid growth against the backdrop of continued macro headwinds for enterprise software. In Q4, we saw over 50% year-over-year growth in our Polaris (NYSE:PII) software integrity platform. Polaris is a SaaS based application security testing solution optimized for the needs of development and DevSecOps teams. We were also recently recognized as a leader in the Forrester Wave for Software Composition Analysis. This was based on an evaluation of Black Duck, our software composition analysis solution. In summary, we had an outstanding Q4 and FY 2023 financial results and operational execution and take tremendous forward momentum into 2024. We have a resilient business model and our customers continue to prioritize investments in the chips and systems that position them for future growth. We are aligning our portfolio investment with the greatest return potential to accelerate our growth, deepest thanks to our employees, partners, and customers for their passion and commitment. With that, I'll turn it over to Shelagh.
Shelagh Glaser: Thank you, Sassine. 2023 was an excellent year highlighted by record revenue, record non-GAAP operating margin, and record earnings. We continue our strong execution with financial discipline and are confident in our business heading into 2024, driven by our execution and leadership position across our segment, robust chip and system design activity by our customers who continue to invest through semiconductor cycles and with $8.6 billion in non-cancellable backlog, the stability and resilience of our time-based business model. As a result, while the macro environment is uncertain. We expect to grow revenue 12.4% to 13.5%, expand non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points, and drive non-GAAP PPS growth of 19% to 20% in 2024. Let me provide some highlights of our full year 2023 results. We generated total revenue of $5.84 billion, up 15% over the prior year, with double digit growth across all key products and geographies. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $4.6 billion and total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $3.8 billion, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 35.1%. GAAP earnings per share were $7.92 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $11.19, up 26% year-over-year. Now onto our segment. Design automation segment revenue was $3.78 billion, up 14% driven by strengths in EDA software and hardware. Design automation adjusted operating margin was 38.1%. Design IP segment revenue was $1.54 billion, up 17%, driven by broad-based strength. Design IP adjusted operating margin was 34.5%. Software integrity revenue was $525 million, up 13%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.5%. Turning to cash. Operating cash flow for the year was $1.7 billion. We ended the year with cash and short-term investment of $1.59 billion and total debt of $18 million. During the year we completed buybacks of $1.2 billion or 80% of free cash. Now to targets which reflect the impact from export control regulations and assume no further changes for the year. Based on our current assessment of timing of hardware and IP deliveries, we expect the first half, second half split of approximately 48% to 52% for revenue and non-GAAP EPS. For fiscal year 2024, the full year targets are revenue of $6.57 billion to $6.63 billion, total GAAP costs and expenses between $5.0 billion and $5.05 billion, total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $4.14 billion and $4.18 billion, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin improvement of roughly 2 percentage points, non-GAAP tax rate of 15%, GAAP earnings of $9.07 to $9.25 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $13.33 to $13.41. Cash flow from operations of approximately $1.4 billion, which includes an impact of approximately $200 million of 2023 taxes that we will pay in ‘24 and approximately $400 million of higher cash taxes due to the amortization of R&D expense. Following 2024, we expect cash tax growth rate to be approximately in line with operating income growth over a multi-year period. Now to targets for the first quarter, which includes an extra week compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue between $1.63 billion and $1.66 billion, which includes approximately $70 million from the extra week. Total GAAP cost and expenses between $1.22 billion and $1.24 billion, total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $1.02 billion and $1.03 billion, GAAP earnings of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $3.40 to $3.45 per share, including approximately $0.14 from the extra week. Our press release and financial supplement include additional targets and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. I also want to highlight that we will be hosting our Investor Day on March 20th, which will be held in conjunction with our Synopsys Users Group event in Santa Clara. We look forward to seeing many of you there. In conclusion, we entered 2024 with momentum and confidence, reflecting our leadership position across our segments, robust design activity by our customers who continue to invest through semiconductor cycles, and the stability and resiliency of our time-based business line. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong execution and fiscal ‘24 guidance.
Aart de Geus: Thank you.
Harlan Sur: You're welcome. Hardware verification, emulation, prototyping, I mean, this has been a big contributor to your double digits revenue growth profile over the past number of years. Lots of customers focusing on verification on these very complex chip designs, a lot of them wanting to get a head start on the embedded and application software development. Is the team anticipating another strong year next year for hardware? Will it be growing at a double-digit sort of growth rate within your fiscal ‘24 guidance? And if I look at inventories, right, they're up 53% year-over-year to kind of record levels, which I think is a good indicator of a strong hardware pipeline, but wanted to get your views.
Sassine Ghazi: Yeah, thanks for the question. In terms of the need, exactly the way you highlighted it, the requirement to develop software early and having a hardware assisted verification to enable that step in the process is not only continuing, is accelerating with many system companies are trying to design their chip or even if they're getting a chip from a semiconductor company, they want to start their software development and verification of the system early. And this is where our HAPS and ZeBu platform comes in to enable that part of the solution. We're anticipating that to continue into 2024. As you saw as well, we had a record year for our hardware-assisted verification in ‘23, and we don't anticipate anything different that will change going into 2024. As for the inventory comment, I'll turn it to Shelagh for comments.
Shelagh Glaser: Sure, as Sassine said, we had a record in 2023. We expect another record in 2024, and we're building inventory to be able to fulfill our customer demands.
Harlan Sur: Perfect. And maybe a similar question on your IP business, strong growth last year, right, up 17% going forward. I mean just continued tailwinds, right? Chip design complexity, driving more reliance on off-the-shelf IP licensing. And just as importantly, right, there's some pretty big transitions on the interface and connectivity side, PCIe Gen 5, CXL, DDR5, HBM3e. Looking at your pipeline backlog, customer programs, will the IP business be growing slower, faster in line with the fiscal '24 sort of total revenue profile?
Sassine Ghazi: So again, exactly the way you're outlining the requirement, there is two factors. There's the complexity and then there is the different methods of designing an SoC or chip with multi-die is opening up the door for new protocols, UCIE, the PCIe, the CXL, the one that you've listed. There are different protocols for various markets for automotive. As they expand their sophistication in developing the electronic system, it requires different requirements for the IP, interface IP for an automotive application. What we outlined in the script as well is today, we are the leading supplier for TSMC, Samsung (KS:005930) and Intel Foundry business. And that puts us in a great position because most of these complex chip developments are on these advanced foundries. And today, we are in a very fortunate position to be the partner and the leader in providing the IP for that business. So we expect that growth to continue, given the market demand for the sophisticated chips will continue.
Harlan Sur: Great insights. Thank you.
Sassine Ghazi: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Joe Vruwink with Baird.
Joe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I maybe want to start by parsing out some of the demand commentary. So first, there was a big step-up in backlog. I'd imagine that bodes well for 2024 and 2025 positive for revenue. At the same time, maybe the incremental moderation you're signaling in China, as I think about just the last 12 months, I think China contributed about 2 points worth of revenue growth, just the incremental revenue contribution from China. So arriving at the 13% growth guidance, are you really seeing kind of good strength, something better than 13% and then China is maybe just a more neutral factor in your outlook?
Sassine Ghazi: We really took a balanced approach as we look at the guidance and the forecast for FY '24. We took into account some of the headwinds that we're seeing and of course, the number of the tailwinds that we are observing in the market. A couple of the headwinds, as we mentioned, one of them is China. And the two factors. One is the continued export restrictions and the other one that I'm sure all of you are observing, which is the macro economy inside China. The other headwind we took into account is the continued stress and pressure from enterprise software spending that does impact our software integrity business. From tailwinds, and this is where we get excited about is exactly what we're seeing, the AI as a megatrend is driving amazing silicon demand and that silicon demand is complex. It's on the most advanced nodes and it's giving us an amazing opportunity for our design automation and design IP. So as we took into account the both headwinds and the tailwinds. We came with a balanced view of the guidance around 13% midpoint for FY '24.
Joe Vruwink: Okay. That's clear. Thank you. And then just on the topic of Generative AI, I did want to maybe get your take, if it's possible to contrast just the pace of product development incorporating such a technology relative to what you've done in the past? And I guess the context for this question, as I think back to DAC in July, there were actually members of the Microsoft verification team speaking about how they wanted more robust tools from their EDA vendors that incorporated GenAI and we're not very far from July. And here you are with a product in conjunction with Microsoft and now Microsoft verification is using this in their workflows. So it seems like a very quick turnaround. Is it that much quicker than maybe what Synopsys was able to do in the past?
Sassine Ghazi: Maybe we made it look too easy, Joe, but there was a lot of work that started well ahead of the DAC time frame. If I take a quick step back, when we talk about Synopys.ai, there are really four pillars under it. The one that we -- the first one we did produce was DSO.ai in the 2020 time frame. That was focused mostly on optimizing the -- our product and using every opportunity to leverage machine learning and AI in the product and around the product. The second pillar, which is what we're calling a collaborative capability using Gen AI, and that's what we announced with Microsoft, which is using a CoPilot approach for supporting our users for knowledge-based or workflow-based or results co-pilot and assistance. And that's in our announcement where AMD, Intel, Microsoft were some of the early users of the technology. Then we talked a little bit about what's coming down the path, which is around both generative and autonomous capability using Gen AI and natural language. We're super excited actually about the early results we're seeing with the co-pilot in terms of the productivity of our customers and users.
Joe Vruwink: Great. Thank you very much.
Sassine Ghazi: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my questions. If I remove the -- I think you said about $17 million or so impact of the extra week, you're guiding to roughly 12% sales growth right, which seems to be very conservative relative to the strong backlog that you have built up. So I'm curious, Sassine, I think you mentioned the impact of China and enterprise software and AI is kind of neutral, but then when I look at the 12% growth that is lower than what you had in the last three years, even though there is all this AI excitement that's starting now, so is it conservative? How should we kind of put this 12% in the context of the kind of growth rates we are used to seeing from Synopsys over the last three years?
Shelagh Glaser: So, Vik, thanks for the question. This is Shelagh. I'll jump in on that. So we're obviously taking a balanced stance as Sassine had talked about at the we're at a 13% growth year-over-year. And we're seeing design automation, Design IP have incredibly strong momentum. You mentioned the $8.6 billion backlog. We're seeing that growth in line with our long-term targets. And we're seeing AI as a catalyst, but it's in its early inning. So we think it's a long-term growth catalyst. And we're looking forward to having it be able to help drive our business over the horizon. But the two headwinds are China, as we've talked about the macro situation in China and the restrictions that have been imposed on China, are having some dampening effect. We expect China to grow in '24, but at a lesser rate than it grew in '23. And the other headwind that we have is we are expecting a muted environment for enterprise software spend to impact our software integrity business, and we're assuming that, that business will be single-digit growth in 2024. So it's the combination of those headwinds and tailwinds that's leading to our 13% growth rate at the midpoint.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, the AI Copilot seems like a very interesting new product. I'm curious what is the right way to track how you are able to monetize it? Are you selling it as incremental feature? Are you selling it as a separate tool? What is the right way to just kind of track how successful you are with this capability?
Sassine Ghazi: So the way we're thinking and we expect this over the last few calls, which is AI will be offered to our customers through a subscription license, meaning, if a customer wants to use an AI capability, be it a DSO.ai or VSO.ai, it will be offered as an incremental spend for the customer to get access to that technology. And in some early adopter cases where they’re still not ready to make the long-term commitment, we're offering it as well in terms of consumption base. They may be looking for one project to use it, et cetera. And the Copilot in particular case, it's still be early, fairly maybe early stage in terms of us to talk about monetization and how is it contributing overall. But those are the flexibility tools per se, we're providing the customer to get access to it.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Sassine Ghazi: Thank you, Vivek.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jason Celino with KeyBanc.
Jason Celino: Great. Thanks for taking my question. The backlog number, it's quite impressive. Looking back at the last couple of years, it looks like it's sequentially the biggest quarter-over-quarter increase we've ever seen, up 20% year-over-year. Just wanted to check how much of this has been driven just from the AI design activity or the AI tool revenue. It sounds like it was more broad-based, but just wanted to check.
Sassine Ghazi: With AI, we communicated last quarter that what we're observing on average and that average emphasizing the average because in some cases, we were seeing a much bigger number or a lesser number. About 20% contract-over-contract growth when a customer is renewing their EDA agreement and asking for the AI capability to be added. The other point that I made earlier with Vivek, I'd like to emphasize as well, that we are in early stages of that monetization with AI. We still have customers that they are in early adoption, meaning if they have x number of projects, they may be using it on one or two projects and other customers, they started early and they're going more aggressively. But to give you a sense, it's roughly 20% on the EDA side contract-over-contract growth we're observing.
Jason Celino: Okay. Interesting. Thank you. And then one question on the OCF guidance. It will be down next year. Are you saying that there's a $600 million headwind from cash taxes and then additional amortization and then are you saying it's going to grow just in line with net income growth that you're after? Can you clarify?
Shelagh Glaser: Yeah, Jason, thanks for the question. So the total impact from taxes is $600 million as we're moving to the new tax guidance where R&D is capitalized. Out of that $600 million, $200 million of it was payable in November. We've already paid it, which was for 2023 and then $400 million of that $600 million is for 2024. And again, both of those are impacted by the amortization of R&D. As we move forward, as we move into 2025 and beyond, we anticipate that the growth of the cash tax rate will align with the growth the growth of our operating income. So there is a bit of a big step up this year. We do not anticipate that same level step up as we move forward.
Jason Celino: Got it. But this is the new base level, right?
Shelagh Glaser: It is because we're now going forward for the foreseeable future, we will be amortizing R&D. And for us, about half of our R&D is in the US and about half of our R&D is outside the US. So that new scheme is with us for the foreseeable future.
Jason Celino: Got you. Okay, great. Thank you.
Sassine Ghazi: Thank you.
Shelagh Glaser: Thank you, Jason.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.
Jay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening. For Aart and Sassine, first and a financial follow-up for Shelagh. For Aart and Sassine, one of the tailwinds that you've had for the last number of years, and we've spoken about this often is what you've referred to as domain-specific architectures on the part of your customers or specialty chips. And AI is probably a very special case of that. The question is, how do you think the whole phenomenon of the main specific design at either the chip or system level is going to be fundamentally altered by the AI phenomenon? And in turn, what does it mean for any additional investments you need to make outside of R&D, for example, in AE capacity services, et cetera?
Sassine Ghazi: Yeah. Thank you, Jay, for the question. You're right. The whole domain-specific architecture I want to say, about six, seven years ago, we started seeing a number of customers investing in it, mostly hyperscalers. And you can argue before that couple of the mobile companies started optimizing based on their own system software optimizing their silicon. With the hyperscalers, initially, the target was -- can they -- based on the workload -- on a specific workload, can they develop a chip that is more effective for power, performance cost, et cetera. And the answer is yes, and they made a number of these investments. Now you're seeing another wave of expanded investment around AI and how can they train the models that they are creating for, again, their specific applications. And I'm sure you've noticed in the last couple of weeks almost the top three hyperscalers announced their own silicon investments and chips for AI specific training to drive more optimization and efficiency for their work loans. What that means for Synopsys is not only it's another chip that our customer base is investing in, which drives both EDA and IP, typically, they are the most advanced node and different methodology in many cases, they're pushing towards multi-die and chiplets, which opens up the door for IP and the comments I made earlier. From our solution point of view, yes, we're expanding the solution offering to enable our customers to design these complex chips. On IP, I want to say it's fairly straightforward. You deliver [to] (ph) standards to connect these chips. But the work is not straightforward, but the road map is fairly straightforward what you need to do. On the EDA side, we have a number of those customers using 3DIC Compiler, which gives them the ability to architect that chip for that system in that case. SLM (NASDAQ:SLM), the silicon life cycle management to give them the ability to trace the health and the connectivity of these dives into the system and all the way in the field or in the hyperscale case as it sits into their data center and it's up and running. So we have a number of expansions in our portfolio in order to support these opportunities. And that's why we are bullish and excited about the opportunity to continue the growth for design, automation and design IP.
Jay Vleeschhouwer: For Shelagh, one of the largest components of your backlog has been FSAs which are, I would assume, largely related to IP. Is there any reason to believe that in future, the pull down of FSAs for IP consumption would be faster or larger than has been the case to date? And for that matter, were FSAs a large component of the $1.5 billion sequential increase in backlog that you noted?
Shelagh Glaser: There's not a -- I wouldn't note a different percent of FSAs. It's certainly something that many of our customers who are purchasing IP prefer that model, but there's not a different mix.
Sassine Ghazi: Thanks, Jay.
Shelagh Glaser: Thank you, Jay.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Charles Shi with Needham.
Charles Shi: Hi, good afternoon and congrats on the very strong results, guidance and the backlog number. I want to ask a little bit -- I think a little bit more into the backlog number because you have relatively consistent, I mean, ratios in terms of how much backlog goes into RPO, how much RPO goes into current RPO and how much the current RPO covers next year's revenue. With that, at the same ratio as in the past few years, I thought you would have guided a little bit higher given that $8.6 billion backlog. So how should I reconcile this? Is it something like at this time, the average contract duration is a little bit longer within that $8.6 billion backlog? Or there's some conservatism around what will you want to guide for '24? Thanks.
Shelagh Glaser: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So the backlog was broad-based. It was across multiple customers. And as Sassine said, some of them was larger renewals and new deals that we booked. There was -- there's no change in the duration in our contracts. So there's no change from our typical duration. As we were putting the forecast together for the year, we are really balancing the headwinds and tailwinds that we're seeing in the business, and we're seeing because of the backlog, we're seeing very strong momentum in the core business in design automation and Design IP where we're seeing the headwinds is on China, in particular, which obviously has been a large growth driver for us for the last several years. We're seeing that growth rate slower and then the other one is SIG, which the Software Integrity business is still -- we anticipate going to be impacted by a difficult software enterprise purchasing environment. And so that's why we've got that business forecast at single-digit growth. So it's really the balancing of those things. But we are seeing design automation and design IP aligned with our long-term goals for those businesses.
Charles Shi: Got it.
Shelagh Glaser: Thanks for the question.
Charles Shi: Yeah. Maybe a quick follow-up on the half-over-half profile for next year because I mean, I would think that EDA revenue, I mean, because of its time-based nature and you guys keep signing bigger contracts, you tend to be like up to the right kind of profile through the year, but your relatively flattish half-over-half profile seems to suggest that the IP, maybe some of the hardware is going to be a little bit front half loaded. Is that the case? And why is that a thing?
Shelagh Glaser: Yeah. It's really just the balance of how we see the customers wanting to ingest our hardware and our IP business. So it's fairly aligned also with what we saw in '23 and fairly aligned with what we saw in '21.
Sassine Ghazi: Maybe, Charles, if I -- I'll add a couple of comments to what Shelagh just said. Rough numbers, our design automation is about 65% of our business and then Design IP, 25% and software integrity 10%. And the $8.6 billion is mostly those agreements in EDA and IP. And given the large percentage of the overall revenue we have, which is 25% is IP, there's a different pull down and development of the IP, especially on the advanced nodes, when we're talking about we're developing our IP portfolio on the most advanced foundries, from the day you find an agreement to the day you deliver, there's a time lapse by when that you deliver the IP and you get the pull down. So while the backlog number, the $8.6 billion is large, we need to get, I would say, used to that the consumption for EDA and IP would be very different across that backlog number. And the timing of the renewal et cetera, et cetera.
Trey Campbell: Thanks, Charles. Let's do one more question and then if you could turn it back over to me, Lisa.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank.
Gianmarco Conti: Hi, there. Thank you for taking the questions. So I guess the first one would be, how should we think about the recurring revenue rate into 2024? Is it fair to assume that given that we're expecting another record [hard year] (ph) into '24, it will inch closer to 80%. And secondly, could you provide some more color on the SIG strategic initiatives that you're considering?
Sassine Ghazi: Maybe I'll talk about the SIG initiative, and Shelagh will comment on the backlog. The -- what we've said in the remarks that we went through a strategic portfolio review, just to put some context around what we went through. As I stated earlier, we have the three business segments and we are truly fortunate that we have a leading position in each one of those segments. As we look at the opportunities over the next five to 10 years of these market segments, I cannot express how excited we are about the opportunities we have in design automation and design IP. And the more we can expand our portfolio within these market segments. So that led us to discuss and make a decision to explore the strategic alternatives for software integrity to put priority of where to make our investments and where we believe there's a higher ROI for the investments based on the 90% of our portfolio between the design automation and design IP business segments. So that's really the process that we went through in order to get to that point.
Shelagh Glaser: Yeah. And I would add that on the recurring revenue question, we're not expecting a substantial change in that. We've had a record hardware year in '22 and '23, and we're expecting another one in '24, but the overall business is growing too. So it won't substantially change the mix of recurring revenue. Thank you for the question.
Trey Campbell: Thanks, Johnny. Let me turn it over to Aart for some closing remarks.
Aart de Geus: Thank you. A couple of personal words in closure here. Since the IPO in 1992, this is my 128th earnings call. I did not miss a single one, but I suspect that literally only Jay Vleeschhouwer remembers exactly what was said at each one of these calls. So a big thank you to you, Jay. But really huge gratitude to all of you for your feedback, you have write-ups, your advocacy on the market, but also for never giving up on asking questions where you perfectly well know that we will never answer them. So I really hope that you will keep that up with Sassine. But more importantly, a gratitude for having been travel made and family members in raising this fragile Synopsys start-up child into the strong worldwide market and technology leader that is today. Thank you. Now some CEO transitions are hard, but I think we're doing very well. Sassine is the perfect choice for CEO. He already leads with ambition, heart and smart and of course, his 25 years of experience at Synopsys is comprehended is complemented, I should say, by great customer relationships and very importantly, trust. Sassine has my respect, my enthusiasm and my full support. So please give him your support as well. With that, I look forward to from time to time, touching base with you, so until then, be well and thank you very much.
Trey Campbell: Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Lisa, can you close this out?
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation today. You may now disconnect.

The company expects the effects of AI to unfold gradually, with incremental workload utilization and consumption growth. The executives also mentioned the upcoming FedRAMP high authorization and the importance of unstructured data and Document AI in driving their business.
Snowflake also discussed the utilization of higher tiers by large enterprises, the impact of AI on the business, consumption trends, container services, go-to-market strategies, unstructured data support, and legacy replatforming. They highlighted the continued migration of on-premise workloads to the cloud and the expansion of workloads within existing customers.
In terms of payment models, Snowflake continues to push for three-year contracts but may offer more flexible payment terms in the future. The company's top 10 customers have shown strong quarter-over-quarter growth, driven by large data estates and workload migrations. The company's product gross margins may face headwinds in Q4 due to the costs associated with new product development and software fine-tuning. However, Snowflake does not anticipate significant upside in their long-term margin guidance.InvestingPro InsightsIn light of Snowflake Inc.'s recent Q3 fiscal 2024 earnings report, several key metrics from InvestingPro provide additional insight into the company's financial health and market position. Snowflake's market capitalization stands at a robust $61.88 billion, reflecting investor confidence in its business model and growth prospects. Despite a negative P/E ratio of -69.95, analysts remain optimistic about the company's potential, as indicated by the 20 analysts who have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period—suggesting an expectation of improved financial performance.
From a growth perspective, Snowflake has demonstrated a significant revenue increase of 40.87% over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024, with a gross profit margin of 67.09%. This growth is a testament to the company's ability to scale effectively and maintain profitability at the gross level.

Thank you for attending today's Q3 FY 2024 Snowflake Earnings Conference Call. My name is Hannah and I will be your moderator for today's call. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations at Snowflake. You may go ahead.
Jimmy Sexton: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us on Snowflake's Q3 fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me in Bozeman, Montana are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; v, our Chief Financial Officer, and Christian Kleinerman, our Senior Vice President of Product, who will join us for the Q&A session. During today's call, we will review our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, products and features, long-term growth, our stock repurchase program and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2023, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended of 2023 that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations. We'd also like to point out that on today's call, we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To see the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today and our investor presentation, which are posted at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.
Frank Slootman: Thanks, Jimmy. Welcome and good afternoon. Q3 product revenue grew 34% year-over-year to reach $698 million. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $111 million, representing 7% year-over-year growth. Results reflect strong execution in a broadly stabilizing macro environment. while Snowflake's global revenue mix is highly diverse in terms of industries and geographies, the company derives an ever larger revenue share from mainstream enterprises and institutions. This, as compared to a newer crowd of digital natives, have made up many of Snowflake's early adopters. We added 35 $1 million plus customers during the quarter, 9 of our top 10 customers grew sequentially. Generative AI is at the forefront of customer conversations, which in turn drives renewed emphasis on data strategy in preparation of these new technologies. We said it many times, there's no AI strategy without a data strategy. The intelligence we're all aiming for results in the data, hence the quality of that underpinning is critical. Meanwhile, Snowflake has announced and showcased the plethora of new technologies that let customers mobilize AI. We've introduced Snowflake Cortex to leverage AI and machine learning on Snowflake. Cortex is a managed service for inferencing large language models. This opens up direct access to models and specialized operations by translation, sentiment and vector functions. Business analysts and data engineers can now use AI functionality without the fractured highly technical challenges of the AI landscape. Last summer, we introduced Snowpark Container Services, which also serves as the second pillar of our AI enablement strategy. Developers can access any language, any library and flexible hardware inside the governance boundary of Snowflake. More than 70 customers are already using container services in preview with many more waiting in line. Snowflake makes the common AI use case is easy and the advanced use case is possible. We are well positioned for AI based on the scale and scope of our data cloud programmability and governance framework. There are hurdles challenging enterprise adoption of AI and ML. The first is broad access to quality data. Snowflake addresses this challenge through its data sharing architecture. 28% of all our customer share data, up from 22% a year ago and 73% of our $1 million-plus customers are data sharing up from 67% a year ago. AI models can only be as smart as data they are trained on. Security and governance present another challenge for enterprise adoption of AI and the now Snowflake Horizon offers a unified security and governance solution built for AI. Horizon strictly and consistently enforces user privileges on data across use cases, including large language model applications, traditional ML models and ad hoc queries. As part of Horizon, we introduced universal search, which enables customers to search the data cloud. Customers can now discover data and metadata that exists across their accounts and in the Snowflake marketplace. Snowflake continues to win new workloads outside of its traditional. Snowpark's consumption grew 47% quarter-over-quarter. Consumption in October was up over 500% since last year. Over 30% of customers use Snowflake to process unstructured data in October. Consumption of unstructured data was up 17 times year-over-year. Our newest streaming capability, Dynamic Tables entered public preview earlier this year. Approximately 1,500 customers are using the feature and initial adoption is outpacing expectations. We have a number of major new capabilities becoming broadly available in Q4. Our native apps framework will go GA, UniStore for transaction processing, Snowpark Container Services and Apache Iceberg Tables will all enter public preview. These products unlock substantial new workload expansion opportunities. We are campaigning globally to expand our audience. This fall, our Data Cloud World Tour traveled to 26 cities worldwide. In-person attendance at these events reached 23,000 nearly double from last year. Next up is our Build Developer Conference in early December, where we anticipate 35,000 registrations. Build is focused on building apps, data pipelines and AI/ML workflows. We hope to see you there. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. In Q3, we saw strong consumption from a broad base of customers. Our performance was evenly split between large and small accounts largest customer stabilized as expected. Migrations drove growth in Q3. Our two fastest-growing customers who are both migrating workloads from a legacy vendor. One of these accounts is in their second year on the platform, the other in their eighth year on the platform. We added four customers with more than $5 million and two customers with more than $10 million in trailing 12-month product revenue in the quarter. Growth in September exceeded expectations. For three weeks, consumption grew faster than any other period in the past two years. Consumption continued to grow in the month of October. Q3 represented a strong quarter for bookings execution. Remaining performance obligations grew 23% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. Of the $3.7 billion in RPO, we expect 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. APJ and SMB drove growth in net new bookings. We are making significant progress in delivering margin expansion. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 78% was up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Improved terms from the cloud service providers have contributed to margin expansion. We also benefit from increasing consumption of higher-priced additions of Snowflake. In Q3, price per credit increased 4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 10% was ahead of expectations. Operating margin benefited from revenue outperformance and increased hiring scrutiny. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 15%, benefiting from favorable timing of collections. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Our strong cash position allows us to opportunistically repurchase shares. In Q3, we used $400 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares. Year-to-date, we have used $592 million to repurchase 4 million shares at an average price of $147.5. Now let's turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect product revenue between $716 million and $721 million, representing year-over-year growth between 29% and 30%. We're increasing our full-year guidance to approximately $2.65 billion, representing 37% year-over-year growth. Consumption trends have improved. We are seeing stability in customer expansion patterns. Our guidance is based on observed patterns and assumes continued stability of consumption. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating margin of 4% and 360 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full-year, we are increasing our non-GAAP product gross margin guidance. We now expect non-GAAP gross margin of 77%. We still expect a product gross margin headwind in the fourth quarter associated with new products. We are increasing our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP operating margin guidance. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin of 7%. We are increasing our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin. We now expect non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 27%. For the full-year, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 361 million. We are on track to add more than 1,000 employees this year, inclusive of M&A. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark Murphy: Thank you so much. I love the 11-minute earnings call, and congrats on a fantastic result. So Frank, we are hearing broadly that conversations are starting with generative AI and they're stopping at data, because they find their data estates aren't in good enough shape. Are you sensing more tangible uplift there around that concept that Snowflake might be on the front edge of AI projects and perhaps seeing that spill over into customer conversations or drive more pipeline for some of your other products like Snowpipes and Snowpark and data sharing?
Frank Slootman: Generally speaking, yes, one of the interesting things is that customers are now getting preoccupied with their data estates because they have to get them into shape where they can productively take advantage of the newer technologies, which we are now also showcasing and delivering where they can just turn it on and have well-governed frameworks to run them with all the things that they're used to from Snowflake. So it's definitely true that the frenzy and the high degree of interest in AI has a knock-on effect on the interest in data strategy, data platforms. And people are also not just looking at the quality of their data and the optimization of the organization curation of data but also what kind of data they need to be able to have access to. So people are taking a much broader view of their data estates as well in terms of what's in it and what should be in it.
Mark Murphy: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Our next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you guys. [Indiscernible] on for Keith. Maybe just start off with a quick question on sort of you mentioned several times on the call, the stabilization that you are seeing in your -- with the new growth. And we've obviously heard that from sort of your hyperscaler peers as well. When you're looking at an account level, could you give us sort of an idea like how much of the stabilization is coming from cost optimization, scrutiny alleviating versus sort of existing customers who slow what migrations leaning in more versus customers leaning more into new products? Is there any way that you can kind of give us more color, what parts are playing out already and which are yet to come maybe into the next year?
Frank Slootman: Keith, one of the things, it is Frank. What I mentioned is our customer base has evolved in recent years to include much larger enterprises and institutions who are typically not prone to over consumption and unbridled expansion that they then later have to reset and rationalize. Because of that, the exposure to these drastic resets and optimization that we saw earlier in the year is getting less and less with each incremental quarter. Secondly, people have really driven themselves through these processes and rationalized themselves and are now in a good place to move forward. You can only optimize and rationalize so much. At some point, it's diminishing returns. People get tired of us and they're moving on to things that are now new and interesting, namely preparing for enabling AI and ML technologies.
Mike Scarpelli: I'll add to that, too, that why we see that stabilization is nine out of our top 10 customers all grew quarterly sequentially. And the other point I'll make is we are seeing a shift, as Frank mentioned. Our biggest customers are mature enterprises we're seeing now and mature enterprises have always scrutinized cost. They always will. And so there's nothing new there, and that will continue. And that's just the way anyone should run a business.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe one quick question on your sales and marketing headcount. Obviously, we noticed it's basically flat quarter-over-quarter this quarter. But then again, it's only sort of one number. Can you shed some light in terms of like what regions are you may be leaning more into versus getting more efficiencies or any sort of areas that you're investing in still? Because obviously, your growth seems pretty healthy. So just some color on where you're investing, would be helpful.
Mike Scarpelli: Yes. So first of all, in general, with sales and marketing heads, most of those typically are added right at the end of Q4 or even more so at the beginning of Q1, so people can get involved in our sales kickoff. And what I would say is we are continuing to invest very heavily in our sales and marketing function, in particular, in Europe. We talked about six months ago or so, we added a new leader there. We have been changing out some people and investing, and we're continuing to, and we will continue to prune underperformers globally and invest more in the right people as we go forward. And APJ is another one that we continue to invest in.
Unidentified Analyst: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Weiss. Our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. You may proceed.
Raimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Guys, you have like a crazy amount of new exciting products coming out. How do you think about the sales setup here now going forward? Because you're going to be able to address lots of different areas from like classic data to kind of more AI. Does that mean your sales approach needs to change, Frank, here going forward? And it doesn't sound like you are going to have a crazy sales force expansion here. Like how do you want to do that going forward and ensure that all these new products are actually finding the market? Thank you.
Frank Slootman: Yes that's actually an excellent observation. We have historically had sort of one dominant selling motion that we sort of deployed everywhere and anywhere. It has served us well. But as you correctly observed, the market has really changed. When you go back to 2015, Snowflake really swam in swim lanes that were very narrowly defined and very well understood. Now we're in the mega market, right? These are very, very broad-based platforms that are incredibly capable in many directions. And we've been working very hard, as you've seen in recent years, in delivering just an absolute ton of capabilities to enable these platforms in all these different directions. I mean, our drive towards applications and the whole programmability framework, the onslaught of AI and AM and our capabilities, all of that is coming to fruition. Now we have a ton of irons in the fire, and they're now all getting hot. So from a sales standpoint, we have much more specialization happening and that is going to literally going all over the world because it is impossible for a single person to be to be expert in all these technologies and all these disciplines. So we're going to have people that have general purpose capabilities, sort of core skills, if you will, and then we will have teams of specialists that will augment these groups wherever they're needed. So our basic selling motions and how they are supported will evolve rapidly in the coming year.
Raimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Lenschow. Our next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Kirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Congrats on the quarter. I guess, Mike, could you just talk about the impact that some of these newer unstructured data workloads are having on consumption at all, meaning I assume it's still a very, very small part of overall consumption when you look at it, but is that helping with the stabilization? Can they turn into sort of catalyst for acceleration as we get into '24? Anything you to sort of dimensionalize the impact that has as we think out to next year? Thanks.
Mike Scarpelli: Well, they're definitely helping with stabilization. I can't quantify exactly what unstructured is doing, but it's not just that. It's also we're starting to see the effects more of Snowpark that's doing very well for us right now. Some of the new things we're already seeing very early uptick in streaming and dynamic tables. We really, I would say, Streamlit is built into our forecast for next year. The other products because they're new, we really don't build much in for that because we need history before we can do that. And clearly, we think a lot of these new products that are just going into public preview now and GA next year will be a catalyst for growth for us in 2025.
Frank Slootman: One follow-on, Kirk. Document AI is a technology that we've been working on for quite a while, and it really was on the basis of an acquisition we did over a year ago. That is now going into preview. And it is incredibly popular out there and what Document AI does returns to an unstructured document into a semi-structure document. So it can become a full participant in analytical processing. There is a ton of interest in that. And so that really brings the entire estate of unstructured data, which is 80% of the world's data into the analytical sphere. So we do expect that to become very important, and especially because AI and LLMs are so heavily focused on unstructured data, textual data, at least today, this will be something that will be a driver in our business.
Kirk Materne: Thanks. And Mike, can you just give us an update on where the federal sort of opportunity stands? I know you guys were waiting to hear back on FedRAMP. Any update on that? Thanks.
Mike Scarpelli: Federal is a huge opportunity, and I would say it's upside for us because it's such a small piece, but we should have our FedRAMP high authorization literally any day. I actually thought I might have had it today. So stay tuned. You'll see an announcement on that very soon.
Kirk Materne: Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Materne. Our next question is from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. You may proceed.
Brad Reback: Great, thanks very much. Just a quick technical question with Graviton 4 now being announced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), should we think of any potential headwinds there?
Mike Scarpelli: Well, as we told you before, every year, we count on a 5% headwind associated with software hardware improvements. Graviton 4 was just announced recently. We really have not tested that and not all hardware improvements benefit our software. We expect there will be some, but we just don't know. It's too early, stay tuned and we'll update you when we have more information.
Brad Reback: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Reback. Our next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Ethan Bruck: Hey, guys. This is Ethan Bruck for Alex Zukin. Congrats on the nice quarter. My question is, if you're assuming the consumption trends persist through 4Q, and that's how you're guiding, I guess, what would be the biggest puts and takes to accelerate growth next year? And in the same vein, when we think about NRR, just given the stabilizing consumption trends, I guess, directionally, when should we think about when would we expect NRR to stabilize trough and around like what level would you expect?
Mike Scarpelli: So I'll start with -- I'm not going to guide to NRR. I do see it stabilizing. It could dip a little bit more. I do expect over time, NRR, as we've said, we'll converge with our revenue growth. at the size we're at. And clearly, the biggest puts and takes for next year is going to be the -- to continue to see the stabilization we have we're seeing right now and what the impact of a lot of our new initiatives are going to be next year, and it's just too early to tell right now and to guide to that. So stay tuned for our February call when we give guidance for next year.
Ethan Bruck: Great. Thank you very much, Scarpelli.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Zukin. Our next question is from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Brent Thill: Thanks, Mike. I think you mentioned there is a higher utilization on the higher tiers that you're offering. Can you just extrapolate what you're seeing there?
Mike Scarpelli: Well, typically, large enterprises are the ones using our business critical in BPS, and those guys are becoming bigger and bigger customers. And as a result, we do see more of our revenue being derived from these very large companies who are using our higher SKU, which has higher margin for us, and that's what we're seeing there.
Brent Thill: Okay. And quickly for Frank, when you think about just the overall AI impact, do you feel that this is a bigger tailwind in the back half of '24? Do you think you'll see it coming in early '24? How are your thought process in terms of adoption in this way, helping you? When does that impact hit from a monetization perspective?
Frank Slootman: There's going to be a lot of nuances to how AI is going to unfold and translate itself into the effects into our business. It's not just like turning on the switch and all of a sudden, you see incremental consumption happening. As we said during the prepared remarks, we're already seeing that the interest in AI is also driving interest in the data strategy, which then has a knock-on effect on consumption. It's also the expansion of the data universe that people are bringing in quality of the data initiatives. All of that is going to bring incremental workload utilization to Snowflake, even though you would normally not necessarily characterize that as AI, but these are things that are going to enable AI, and it might well be that a ton of the workload of AI is actually the proverbial iceberg where only the tip of it that's ticking above the water is really AI, but everything that has to happen to support us is happening below the service then we're going to be a huge beneficiary of that. We think that Snowflake is super well prepared because our data estates are in a very, very advanced state because our customers have spent years, years and years. And in some cases, literally decades from prior legacy platforms to building these estates and curing the data and organizing and optimizing for the data to be completely trusted and sanctioned in their environment, and that is a huge value when you start tackling AI and ML models.
Brent Thill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Thill. Our next question is from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. You may proceed.
Patrick Colville: All right, thank you so much for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you talked of very strong consumption in September. Consumption continued to grow in October. We're now 29 days through November. Can you just talk about trends thus far this month?
Mike Scarpelli: What I would say is trends are good, but you have to remember, it also has a big holiday in the U.S. and the week of Thanksgiving is typically a slow week. With that said, I'm happy with the consumption we're seeing, and that's reflected in our guidance.
Patrick Colville: Perfect, thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Colville Our next question is from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. You may proceed.
Tyler Radke: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about container services. So it sounds like you're seeing some good early momentum there, more than 70 customers in private preview. I'm curious how many of those are actually deploying large language models directly on the Snowflake data? And for those customers that are doing that, what type of uplift or how you kind of characterize that consumption when they do that?
Christian Kleinerman: Yes. This is Christian. Yes, we have seen a variety of use cases, but a good number of those prior preview customers are leveraging GPU instances in silver and payer services for use of large language models. So for sure, it's a meaningful part of the early adoption use cases and we've got lots of encouragement and excitement to continue the rollout of the preview.
Tyler Radke: Great. And just a question on go-to-market. So I think earlier this year, you talked about some execution issues and it seems like that's been partially resolved to get good results in APAC. I guess, do you feel like you have all the right key sales leaders in place at this point? Or are there still some roles you're looking for? And I guess, ultimately, do you feel like you've turned the corner on those execution issues as well?
Frank Slootman: Yes. It's Frank. Look, in a global sales organization that we're running and we're running all the way from an on-demand selling motion that's unattended, if you will, by salespeople to SMB, to an ISB to mid-range large and then the extremely large customers. The -- it's always a work in process. There's always opportunity for improvement. That's been true for as long as I've been here. That said, I feel we're getting incrementally better, stronger, deeper in terms of our ability to sell. We're becoming much more consistent and more and more productive every day. So a lot of stability and a lot of progress. But this is something that's never over. Anybody who's been in this business knows how this works. It's a very dynamic mix of things. But on the whole, we have to, as a company, a $3 billion or something of that order of magnitude run rate, we lean hard on our organization to show up and deliver those results every quarter. So it's becoming a formidable enterprise in terms of our go-to-market capability.
Tyler Radke: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you Mr. Radke. Our next question is from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.
Brent Bracelin: Thank you and good afternoon. Frank, we'll start with you here. I think last quarter, unstructured data was mentioned twice. You've called it out here more than a dozen times. You talked about October trends being up, I think, 17x increase year-over-year. How much of a game changer is this, particularly as we think about Document AI and Snowpark Containers coming out next year? Clearly, a focus here. It certainly hasn't been an area you supported in the past, but it feels like there's a sea change movement here. How much of a game changer is unstructured data support relative to the growth opportunity going forward?
Frank Slootman: Look, unstructured data, as I said earlier, is the majority of the world's data. And until relatively recently, it's been borderline unusable for analytical purposes, because it is unstructured and you can't reference it in analytical workloads. It's ironic that both through the on slide of large language models that is also extraordinarily of dealing with textual data as well as things just Document AI that Snowflake developed, and it's bringing to the market that this data is going to become a full participant in these types of workloads. It's super exciting. It's going to really enriched and really unlock insights and outcomes and all of that we haven't had before. So this is going to be a driver of our world as we know it in terms of this type of computing.
Brent Bracelin: That's helpful. And Mike, if I look at average consumption revenue per customer, those metrics improved on a growth perspective, slightly year-over-year for the first time in over a year. What are the driving factors there? How much of this is just the optimization headwinds now starting to ease versus net new workloads coming on the platform?
Mike Scarpelli: Well, what I would say, and I'll repeat what I've said at numerous times to investors, optimizations are part of our life. They've been happening at Snowflake from day 1, they will continue to happen. Nothing is new with optimization. I don't see any big ones happening now, but that's not to say they won't happen in the future, because history has shown they happen all the time. Most of the growth that we're seeing within our customers is we talked about two of our biggest growth customers was on-prem legacy migrations into Snowflake. So there's initial migrations, but we're also seeing new workload expansion within existing customers as well, too. So it's -- there's no one thing that's driving it. It's just general consumption we're seeing. And I will say Snowpark is starting to kick in for us. Still not 10% of our revenue. That's a long ways to get there, but it's still meaningful for us.
Brent Bracelin: Great to hear, thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Bracelin. Our next question is from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Derrick Wood: Great. Thanks. I guess I wanted to dovetail off of that on-premise legacy migrations. And I guess for Frank, I mean, when we saw the macro hit, I think it did cause a slowdown in customers looking to re-platform from on-prem to cloud. Just curious, I mean, I know you guys are kind of highlighting the consumption trends improving here. But wondering what you're seeing in the pipeline for new Global 2000 accounts? And if you're seeing legacy replatforming initiatives start to kick back up now that the macro environment has gotten a little bit more stable?
Frank Slootman: Well, I mean, there's no doubt that the legacy replatforming is sort of the hardcore of our business. And almost surprisingly there is just an enormous amount of workloads still sitting on-premise that is still waiting to get migrated to the cloud. So I expect this to continue for a very long period of time. But as what Mike's said is very important. Once you get those data states into the cloud, our new architectures and our new technologies are now enabling opportunities that people haven't had before. And so that drives workload expansion. So it's not just like, okay, we're going to be doing in the cloud where we used to be doing on-premise, and that's the foundation of the business. It is definitely foundational but the opportunity is really what grows from that. That's been the Snowflake story from day one because of what's now possible. We don't have the capacity constraints and people can run unlimited numbers of workloads. And now with all the new technologies in terms of programmability, AI and sky is the limit. I mean, in our conversation with customers, I was telling us is that your problem is no longer the technology. Your problem is your imagination and your budget, right? Not that those are easy things, but technology is not holding us back anymore. It's our ability to harness the technology. And then, of course, you have to pay for it as well.
Mike Scarpelli: Yes. I'll just add to that, Derrick, too, on your question about Global 2000. Yes, we added two Global 2000 last quarter. And as I've said many times before, selling into a Global 2000 as a campaign, it's a one to two, sometimes three year sales cycle. With that said, we have a number of Global 2000 in our pipeline for Q4. And what I also want to see, too, is not every Global 2000 starts with an on-prem migration. Many of them start with a first-gen cloud solution they had purchased to migrate to Snowflake. Yes, almost all of them have an on-prem estate, but that doesn't always happen at first. It really varies by customer. But with that said, we still see a lot of on-prem migration to be done over the coming years, and it's going to be for many, many years.
Derrick Wood: Got it. And Mike, a follow-on for you, really around RPO. And we've heard of more companies looking to take a pay-as-you-go approach. So could you speak to what extent customers are shifting to that approach versus annual or multiyear commits and how that may play into your RPO growth trends looking forward?
Mike Scarpelli: No. I don't see that, that much. The only time you see pay-as-you-go are ones who had signed a 3-year contract and then they run out of capacity. And then they just pay as they go. Actually, one of our top 10 customers is like that. They have until April to continue before they have to do another contract, if they want to get the same pricing that they have. I actually expect Q4 is going to be a pretty significant bookings quarter with a number of renewals that are up or customers are going to do something. And we continue to push for three-year contracts with our customers. Payment terms, I do expect though that is one of the things I'd rather give up on payment terms and discount to price per credit. And that's really, I've said it all along, I anticipate longer term, customers will want to do more monthly in arrears payment terms, and that is available to customers. It all comes down to what price you want to pay per credit. And to date, most people want the lower price per credit and are willing to pay annually in advance.
Derrick Wood: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Wood. Our next question is from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist. You may proceed.
Joel Fishbein: Thanks for my question and congrats on the great quarter. I guess, Frank, this one is for you. Snowflake Summit, you announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft. And I'm just curious how that partnership is going, and you also announced some joint product integration. So I'd love to get an update how that's going and how you feel about that going forward?
Frank Slootman: This is Frank. Yes, we actually saw quite a bit of energy coming from the Azure platform this quarter. The things that we worked on in the renewed relationship with Microsoft is really much better alignment in the field from a compensation standpoint that is just super, super important in our world. And we're seeing the effects of that. And the Microsoft platform really upticked during the quarter. I don't know the exact numbers at hand, but it measurably ticked up. So we're encouraged by the behavior we're seeing in the field, and we're encouraged in the overall sentiment that's developing in the field. So it's definitely healthier than the relationship with Microsoft has been historically. So we're pleased and optimistic about it.
Joel Fishbein: Any milestones we should be looking for there from the partnership?
Frank Slootman: Not really. We'll let you know.
Joel Fishbein: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Fishbein. Our next question is from the line of Mike Cikos -- with Mike Cikos. Please proceed.
Mike Cikos: Thank you for getting me on here. And good to hear some of the earlier comments around Snowpark, which is consistent with some of the growing momentum we've heard in some of our checks. I think the question is probably more for maybe Mike or Christian. But is there enough empirical data or a sizable enough customer base yet for Snowpark to start talking about how these Snowpark customers, I guess, what adoption of Snowpark does for consumption versus non-Snowpark customers? Or maybe how we should think about usage building over time as Snowpark becomes a larger part of those customers' workflows?
Mike Scarpelli: I think it's still too early to tell. I will say -- we have one customer doing a significant migration, which will increase their consumption on Snowflake to roughly $1.5 million a year. And there are a number of those that we've identified in POCs, but we haven't done the migrations. I see that 1 customer going into production right now, which, by the way, has saved them significantly on their legacy vendor. So clearly, the -- with some customers, it's quite meaningful, the consumption we're starting to see, and we expect that trend will continue into next year.
Mike Cikos: Understood. Thanks for calling that out, Mike.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Sikos. Our next question is from Patrick Walravens with JMP. You may proceed.
Owen Hobbs: Hi, this is Owen Hobbs on for Pat. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the strong quarter. So starting off, I guess, how much consumption comes from the different hyperscalers? Is there 1 that kind of is it split evenly between the three or does kind of have the majority of compute share there?
Mike Scarpelli: No. AWS by far is our biggest, followed by Azure and then GCP. GCP is up to 3% right now. Microsoft Azure is the fastest-growing one, but AWS is still 76% of our business with Microsoft being 21%. As I said, GCP is 3%. And I will tell you, 1 of the reasons why GCP is not as big as just so much more expensive for our customers to operate in GCP than it is in AWS and Azure. And as a result, our salespeople are really not inclined to do much in GCP.
Owen Hobbs: Thank you. And then going bigger picture, maybe this is a question for Christian as well. How is the role of the data scientist you sort of kind of changed as we move through the era of big data, machine learning and now into AI? And I guess where do you see that going in the future?
Christian Kleinerman: Yes. We see actual interest on both the traditional data science and ML platform. And we've had a number of announcements at Snowflake for those such use cases, but we obviously see lots of interest on generative AI and large language models where we have also expanded obviously capability to do both hosting via Snowpark Container Services, but more seamless inferencing via the new Snowflake Cortex. So we see strong demand from our broad customer base for both types of use cases.
Owen Hobbs: Good. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Walravens. Our next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. You may proceed.
Gregg Moskowitz: All right. Thank you very much. Frank, since you speak with a lot of large company execs, I'm curious to hear any thoughts you have on IT budgets next year as well as whether there will be incremental budget dollars approved for AI in calendar '24 or if the AI spend will primarily or maybe even entirely come from other areas of IT?
Frank Slootman: I don't even hear the words AI and budget in the same sentence. In other words, they're going to make resources available to enable it. But if anything is holding them back is really understanding how to do it. It takes time in tech to mature and evolve deployment architectures where everybody involved is fully confident and comfortable that these are the right ways to do it. So you see a lot of benchmark and compare and contrast experimentation, testing all these kinds of things. And they're going to go through many, many iterations of that. We will as well. And I think that the field will become very proliferated with large foundational models and many, many, many subsector specialized models that are very, very, very deep, but also are very, very narrow in purpose. So it is going to become an enormous field. I will tell you that when you talk to the C-suite in large enterprises, people are looking for a reset of economics, like, for example, in contact centers, pricing optimization, supply chain management, I mean, really very, very big impact opportunities. These are not sort of marginal incremental and that has the attention. Data has always had a promise, but it's really on steroids now under the influence of the newer technologies that we're all excited about.
Gregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. And then for Mike, really encouraging, of course, to hear that for three weeks, consumption grew faster than any other period over the past two years. Over which three weeks though, did you see that particularly strong consumption? Was that post Labor Day? Or did it span a different time period?
Mike Scarpelli: Post Labor Day.
Gregg Moskowitz: Right, Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Moskowitz. Our last question is from the line of Will Power with Baird. You may proceed.
Will Power: Okay, great. Thanks. Mike, you referenced that nine of your top 10 customers, it sounds like we're nicely quarter-over-quarter. I guess I wonder, were there any common use cases or products or common threads kind of driving that? Any other color behind the strength there?
Mike Scarpelli: No, these are just all very large customers with massive data estates that continue to -- one was doing a big migration, but the others are just continuing to move workloads to Snowflake.
Frank Slootman: That's very industry-specific as well.
Will Power: Okay. And maybe just a quick question on product gross margins. Last couple of quarters, you're kind of already at your longer-term target, I think. It sounds like there may be a couple of headwinds there in Q4, but is this kind of the general level to expect going forward? And maybe any color on kind of the upside surprise, I guess, if you will, given it seems like you've gotten there faster than you might have expected?
Mike Scarpelli: Yes. I don't really see a lot of upside in our long-term guidance and for a number of reasons. The big headwind that we're seeing this quarter to our margin is with all these new products, that are going into public preview. We have to start to amortize the costs associated with the software development costs that we're required to capitalize under GAAP that are now going to start to be amortized on top of that. In particular, something like Unistar, a lot of times when we introduce new products, many times, we actually have negative contribution margins until it takes us usually up to half a year to nine months to actually fine-tune the software to get the -- to take costs out of operating those new features. And so we just have so many new products that are coming out this quarter that is going to have a headwind on the margin.
Will Power: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Power. That concludes the question-and-answer session as well as today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

With that, I will now turn the call over to George.
George Kurtz: Thank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today. I would like to begin my remarks today by expressing gratitude to our customers, who proudly trust CrowdStrike as their cyber security platform consolidator for the AI era; gratitude to our partners who win with CrowdStrike, taking our joint customers on Falcon Platform transformation journeys from device to cloud, to identity, to data and beyond; and to our team for their passion and dedication to our mission, stopping breaches, finding adversaries, and delivering the very best cyber security outcomes. Moving onto Q3. Despite a challenging macro environment and geopolitical tension, I am extremely proud of the resilience of our business and that we delivered a record Q3. CrowdStrike surpassed the $3 billion ARR milestone with an ending ARR of $3.15 billion, growing 35% year-over-year. CrowdStrike is the fastest and only pure-play cyber security software vendor in history to achieve this milestone. In Q3, we delivered double-digit net new ARR acceleration at scale, powered by customer demand for the depth and breadth of CrowdStrike's AI native XDR platform, terrific execution exemplified by rising win rate against our competitors, and acceleration in our cloud security and identity businesses, as well as a record quarter in our LogScale Next-gen SIEM business. Our standout top-line performance came in tandem with P&L discipline as our profitability soared to record heights. Q3 was indeed a quarter of records. Let me share several of our financial highlights. Record net new ARR of $223 million, representing a 13% year-over-year growth from acceleration in new and expansion business; record non-GAAP subscription gross margin; record GAAP and non-GAAP operating profitability; record free cash flow of $239 million, representing 30% free cash flow margin and achieving free cash flow Rule of 66, up from 63 last quarter. Burt will share more color on our financials and platform adoption stats, following my remarks. This was a standout quarter and places us well on the path to $10 billion in ARR that we outlined in our latest investor briefing. The market continues to validate CrowdStrike's widening leadership position. While others scaled back R&D, we are increasing our investments as innovation is the lifeblood of our company. We continue to make meaningful investments in go-to-market and profitable growth. To this end, we received multiple industry awards and accolades over the course of this quarter. Across industry analyst firms, CrowdStrike is consistently top-rated. In Q3, CrowdStrike was awarded a perfect 100% across protection, visibility and analytics detections in MITRE's latest ATT&CK testing in industry-first; recognized as Gartner Customers' Choice and one of the highest-rated in their latest Peer Insights Voice of the Customer for EPP report; named a Leader in the Forrester Wave for Endpoint Security; and positioned as a leader in the IDC Vulnerability Management MarketScape. Our leadership position is translating into record demand for our Exposure Management solution in its first quarter on the market. Our market presence in open platform approach to XDR is a uniting force in cyber security. In Q3, we hosted Fal.Con, our flagship customer and ecosystem event with more than 4,000 attendees and 70 sponsors. This was fast followed by our Fal.Con On the Road series, where we have already hosted Fal.Con Tokyo and Fal.Con Sao Paulo with thousands in attendance. The drumbeat of innovation was loud and clear with multiple releases and announcements showcasing CrowdStrike as the XDR leader, including the Falcon Platform Raptor release, which standardizes all of our customers on LogScale. This builds our platform data gravity, coupling native Falcon data with third-party data ingest, further enabling our customers to realize SIEM and XDR use cases on Falcon. Falcon for IT, a new module to unify IT and SecOps. From hygiene to patching, Falcon for IT lets customers consolidate multiple use cases and replace legacy products with our single-agent architecture. Our new Falcon data protection module that liberates customers from legacy DLP products with modern frictionless data security, which prevents data exfiltration. Falcon Foundry, a no-code application development solution, enabling both customers and technology partners to build directly on Falcon. Foundry epitomizes the true definition of a platform offering limitless apps. We announced the acquisition of Bionic, bringing application security posture management to the Falcon Cloud Security Suite. Falcon Cloud Security is the industry's most comprehensive and innovative cloud security offering, with integrated agent and agentless CSPM, CIEM, CWP, and now, ASPM. We released the beta and pricing for Charlotte AI, our AI-powered [stock] (ph) analyst, which was incredibly well received. CrowdStrike's generative AI leveraging multiple foundational models can turn hours of work into minutes, while democratizing cybersecurity, unlocking value, and adoption across the entire breadth of the Falcon platform. Enthusiasm for Falcon for IT, our automation and hygiene module for IT teams, is exciting to witness because it is something so intuitive that our customers want. Like data protection, Falcon for IT saw a clear and long-neglected pain point, where customers are forced to rely on multiple legacy products that have long outstayed their welcome. Customers are eager to consolidate their agent estate while reducing cost and complexity. Falcon for IT illustrates the power of CrowdStrike's single-platform approach. We have the real estate and data foundation to solve ever-evolving use cases, delighting our customers, while disrupting vendors that have failed to evolve. The resounding takeaway from my customer engagements at Fal.Con and throughout the quarter is that CrowdStrike is the right choice for CISOs, CIOs, executive teams and Boards. Here's why? Our build-by-design, single-platform architecture requires no integration, no stitching, and no platformization. Our unified cloud-native platform and critical beachfront real estate within the customer estate naturally create cybersecurity data gravity, solving for today's challenges, while preparing for the unknowns of tomorrow. Organizations are looking for a trusted cybersecurity consolidator. CrowdStrike is cybersecurity's AI consolidator, liberating organizations from a litany of increasingly ineffective legacy tools, multiple agents, point products, and fragmented pseudo platforms. Illustrating this point, deals with eight or more modules increased 78% year-over-year in the quarter. This is what consolidation looks like. And third, stopping the breach matters more today than ever. Adversaries continue to evolve, moving faster and increasing their use of dark AI, turning AI into a weapon for evil. At the same time, legislative and SEC regulatory oversight pressures Boards and Executives to prioritize cybersecurity. With these three takeaways in mind, let's start by expanding on the first. Why CrowdStrike is the definitive single security platform? Multiple fragmented platforms, consoles, and data silos force customers to focus on integrating, not security outcomes. Our relentless focus on innovation and commitment to a single built-by-design platform creates cybersecurity's source of truth. Built on this platform foundation, our cloud identity and LogScale next-gen SIEM products are examples of IPO-worthy hypergrowth businesses. Let's take a look at our momentum in cloud security. Growth accelerated in the quarter and we're entering Q4 with a record pipeline. Noteworthy wins in the quarter included: an eight-figure total deal value with a new Falcon customer in the hospitality vertical, where we now secure their vast multi-cloud estate as part of a broader Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) replacement; a seven-figure cloud security expansion with one of the largest enterprise SaaS providers, where we replaced multiple existing point products with Falcon Cloud Security; a seven-figure cloud security expansion with a major apparel brand, where we replaced a firewall hardware vendor's cloud security with our unified Falcon Cloud Security offering. CrowdStrike has one of the largest and fastest-growing cloud security businesses by ARR and customer count. The number of customers we protect in the public cloud has increased 45% from last year as we rapidly replace other cloud security vendors in the ecosystem. Point product API-based CSPMs have emerged as the easiest to replace, as the market rapidly adopts our consolidated view that together agent and agentless security stops the breach. Combined with our recently completed Bionic acquisition, we're the only vendor offering ASPM, CSPM, CWP and CIEM under a single CNAPP umbrella. Moving to Identity Threat Protection, where we delivered a record quarter. More and more companies are investing in protection from the growing number of identity-based attacks with highly visible breaches prominently covered in the news over the past few months. Identity Threat Protection wins in the quarter included: an eight-figure total deal value win in the federal government, where Falcon Identity landed as the identity security solution of choice; and multiple seven-figure wins across diverse verticals, including financial services, consumer packaged goods and manufacturing to name a few. We see a long runway for guiding organizations on their zero-trust transformations with our Identity Threat Protection, given a rapidly growing threat vector, a largely untapped market where most organizations aren't protected, and our frictionless unified architecture that secures identity across devices, clouds, domain controllers, and active directory. CrowdStrike pioneered the Identity Threat Protection category, and we are unmatched in the market as the only company with a single-agent solution for both on-prem and cloud environments. Moving to LogScale. Our LogScale next-gen SIEM business achieved new records in Q3, surpassing the $100 million ARR milestone. The combination of search speeds, data gravity, and cost efficiencies, all integrated within the Falcon Platform, sets LogScale miles apart from its competitors. However, it is the future of this business that really excites us. Our LogScale next-gen SIEM opportunity is supercharged by pervasive discontent with legacy SIEMs, recent M&A activity, and CrowdStrike's growing position as cybersecurity's platform of record. We have seen a significant and pronounced increase in interest among customers looking to leapfrog their expensive, cumbersome, and slow legacy SIEM. Our next-gen SIEM offering is the right technology in the right place, at the right time to benefit from market dynamics and the scale of CrowdStrike. Q3 wins include: a seven-figure expansion in a major consumer staples company, selected LogScale to ingest data from third parties, correlate alerts and benefit from long-term data retention; a seven-figure financial services, new customer land, where CrowdStrike was called in to stop a breach, with the desire to operationalize their high-fidelity security data without compromising on cost, Falcon LogScale was an easy choice to replace the incumbent Microsoft; a seven-figure new logo land in a business process outsourcing firm that had decided it was time to replace their antiquated SIEM with LogScale, while also adopting the Falcon Platform for XDR, Identity and Cloud Security. Our advancement into the next-gen SIEM market is accelerated by the Raptor release, which brings LogScale to the forefront of the Falcon Platform experience. With Raptor, we've made it significantly easier for customers to build their security and data lake efforts on top of LogScale next-gen SIEM across our native first-party data and that of any third-party product. Our single-platform approach evolves and broadens the aperture of cybersecurity. CrowdStrike is cybersecurity's AI consolidator, liberating organizations from legacy AV, subpar EDRs, and a hodgepodge of hygiene, compliance, vulnerability, device management tools, costly and clunky SIEMs, and a confusing alphabet soup of immature cloud point products. This lengthy list of costly point products can be left behind, saving tens of millions annually for businesses. Most importantly, stopping the breach matters more today than ever before. Adversaries don't discriminate, no matter the industry vertical, the geography, or the business size, stopping the breach is non-negotiable. The business disruption and financial losses from breaches are growing. [Cutting corners] (ph) on security is one of the most costly choices a business can make. The cost associated with cleaning up a breach can exceed $100 million. Our seminal cybersecurity platform innovation, as well as threat intelligence and service expertise, delivers the best security outcomes. This is why we win. Stopping the breach is the security outcome that CrowdStrike delivers. This makes our business incredibly durable in diverse economic cycles. We are a business necessity. A win this quarter exemplifying our unmatched capabilities is a large multinational, who was using legacy EDR until they were breached. They called CrowdStrike and we quickly remediated the breach. Seeing the power of the Falcon platform, this customer purchased Falcon Complete, Identity Complete, and LogScale next-gen SIEM for hundreds of thousands of workloads. Helping this large multinational in their time of need showcases CrowdStrike's differentiation. Our AI trained on cybersecurity's richest data set drives the industry's most comprehensive protection and automation. We couple the right technology platform with cybersecurity's best and brightest incident responders and the expertise that comes from curating the industry's leading threat intelligence. The need for stopping breaches is not just an enterprise concern. The problem is just as pronounced in the SMB market, especially the S of SMB, where businesses remain stuck on legacy signature-based AV, oftentimes not knowing that better exists for them. Falcon Go is fit for purpose, delivering big protection for their small business. With our latest release of Falcon Go, we deliver a whole new user experience, creating the easy button for cybersecurity, removing the need for CrowdStrike users to have cyber or IT skills. The new console is intuitive and pre-configured for immediate SMB success. We're always looking to remove the friction from the customer experience, and this new release makes Falcon Go as easy as one-click to accelerate customer adoption. Falcon Go is a major step for SMB cybersecurity, and we are now investing in go-to-market. We launched sales of Falcon Go on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Business, a marketplace where over 6 million SMBs purchase everything for their businesses. With Falcon Go, our mission of stopping breaches extends to businesses of all sizes, large and small. Our go-to-market is propelled by our partner ecosystem. Partners bring CrowdStrike into new accounts and drive platform adoption in existing customers. Year-to-date, 62% of all our new logo wins were partner-sourced. The efficacy and success of our channel-led growth was reported by Canalys, the channel's leading industry analyst firm, in their most recent cybersecurity research. Canalys reported CrowdStrike's endpoint market share as number one, ahead of Microsoft. In addition, the research highlights CrowdStrike as the fastest-growing cybersecurity vendor in the channel ahead of Microsoft and Palo Alto networks, among others. We are setting new records. We announced surpassing $1 billion in AWS Marketplace sales. Being the first and fastest cybersecurity vendor to reach this milestone exemplifies CrowdStrike's leadership position as the cloud's cybersecurity platform of choice. And our AWS momentum is not slowing. This past quarter was a CrowdStrike record AWS marketplace quarter. Our global systems integrator alliance partners are increasingly engaging with us across the entire Falcon platform. For example, EY built a 150-person strong and growing global LogScale next-gen SIEM practice, based on the demand they are seeing for SIEM transformation and our technological superiority. In addition, EY refers their clients to CrowdStrike for incident response engagements and secure digital transformation projects. To date, we have done over $160 million in business with EY across 24 countries. In closing, in a challenging macroeconomic environment, which impacted even the largest cybersecurity vendors, we delivered a record Q3, accelerating double-digit net new ARR growth, record free cash flow, and record profitability. Surpassing $3 billion of ARR as the fastest and only pure-play cybersecurity software vendor in history to achieve this milestone validates CrowdStrike's market leadership. Our Q4 setup is strong with a record pipeline, and the competitive gap between CrowdStrike and other players in the market continues to widen. I'm excited about the path we are on and the progress we are making to $10 billion in ARR. Today's cyber environment is exactly why I built CrowdStrike. The adversary is moving faster and the rise of dark AI significantly increases attacker sophistication. Falcon has made cybersecurity easy and effective for small businesses to the world's largest enterprises. Simply put, CrowdStrike is cybersecurity's platform consolidator of choice. The platform is winning at scale. Our customers are looking to Falcon for more, more workloads, more use cases and more security outcomes. CrowdStrike remains unrelenting in our focus and promise, stopping the breach. With that, we have a busy and exciting Q4 ahead of us. And I will now turn it over to Burt for commentary on our financial performance.
Burt Podbere: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. Additionally, the results we are reporting today include the acquisition of Bionic, which closed during the quarter and was de minimis to revenue and ARR. Outstanding execution from the CrowdStrike team resulted in a record third quarter, despite a continued challenging macro environment. Financial highlights in the quarter included: an acceleration in net new ARR growth, driving ending ARR well above the $3 billion milestone; 96% year-over-year growth in operating income and record operating margin; record net income, which more than doubled year-over-year; record GAAP profitability for the third consecutive quarter; and record free cash flow. In the third quarter, we achieved record net new ARR of $223.1 million, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 13%. Demand in the quarter was broad-based, as we expanded our leadership across the market from large enterprises to small businesses. New customer acquisition, strong expansion business within existing customers and a record quarter with the U.S. federal government contributed to the acceleration in net new ARR growth and ending ARR reached $3.15 billion, up 35% year-over-year. We continue to be very pleased with our platform strategy as subscription customers with five or more, six or more and seven or more modules now represent 63%, 42% and 26% of subscription customers, respectively. Our gross retention rate remained high and our dollar-based net retention rate was slightly below our benchmark in Q3, as the mix of net new ARR from new customers has remained above our expectations and we continue to land bigger deals. Moving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 35% over Q3 of last year to reach $786.0 million. Subscription revenue grew 34% over Q3 of last year to reach $733.5 million. Professional services revenue was a record $52.6 million, representing 57% year-over-year growth. The geographic mix of third quarter revenue consisted of approximately 69% from the U.S., 15% from Europe, Middle East and Africa, 10% from the Asia-Pacific region, and 6% from other markets. Our investments in data center and workload optimization that we outlined in our Fal.Con Investor Briefing in September continued to bear fruit, resulting in record subscription gross margin performance above 80% in the third quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $436.1 million, or 55% of revenue, versus $348.6 million last year, or 60% of revenue. Q3 sales and marketing and R&D expenses grew 23% and 31% year-over-year, respectively. We continue to invest aggressively in innovation and growth, while exceeding our profitability expectations. Third quarter non-GAAP operating income grew 96% year-over-year to reach a record $175.7 million and operating margin increased by 7 percentage points year-over-year to reach a record 22%. As we outlined during our Fal.Con Investor Briefing in September, we have once again raised our target model, which now calls for subscription gross margin of 82% to 85%, operating margin of 28% to 32%, and free cash flow margin of 34% to 38%. We expect to achieve our new target model within the next three to five years, as we also flight the company to reach $10 billion of ARR over the next five to seven years. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q3 grew to a record $199.2 million or $0.82 on a diluted per share basis, each more than doubling year-over-year. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate third quarter non-GAAP EPS attributed to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 244 million shares. We ended the third quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $3.17 billion and reflects the $238.7 million payment, net of cash acquired for the acquisition of Bionic. Cash flow from operations was a Q3 record of $273.5 million. Free cash flow reached a record $239.0 million or 30% of revenue, achieving a Rule of 66 on a free cash flow basis. Moving to our outlook. As George outlined, strong demand for the Falcon platform is driving our pipeline to new heights. However, the macro environment remains challenging with continued increased budget scrutiny, and as a result, we are not expecting to see the typical Q4 budget flush. Balancing these factors, we are maintaining our net new ARR assumptions, which call for in-line to modestly up net new ARR for the full year and double digit year-over-year net new ARR growth in the second half. As our guidance reflects, we are raising our full year revenue and profitability expectations for the year. Additionally, we are maintaining our target of 30% free cash flow margin for the full fiscal year. More specifically, for the fourth quarter of FY '24, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $836.6 million to $840.0 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 31% to 32%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $186.5 million to $189.0 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $199.6 million to $202.1 million. We expect diluted non GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.81 to $0.82, utilizing a weighted average share count of 245 million shares on a diluted basis. For the full fiscal year 2024, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,046.8 million to $3,050.2 million, reflecting a growth rate of 36% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $633.6 million and $636.2 million. We expect fiscal 2024 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $715.2 million and $717.7 million. Utilizing 243 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $2.95 to $2.96. George and I will now take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays.
Saket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here, and great to see the net new ARR return to growth in the quarter. George, maybe for you, a lot of great stuff in your prepared remarks to run through, but maybe I'll just stick to one question here. You've talked about how the legacy SIEM market is starting to feel kind of like the legacy AV market did. And of course, we've recently seen some M&A in that market. It's probably too early, but maybe the question is, what are prospective SIEM customers saying to you about LogScale and their willingness to explore other solutions besides their traditional SIEM? Does that make sense?
George Kurtz: It does, yeah. It's a great question. So, when I look at the market today and I compare that to when I started CrowdStrike in 2011 and really talking to customers in 2012 and 2013 about replacing their legacy AV, it feels like it's the same conversation, just with a different context of replacing their legacy SIEM. What I found, and I tend to like businesses and markets where this is in play, is where the incumbents are entrenched, but have a high degree of dissatisfaction, where the technology is legacy and where the complexity is just high of patching all this stuff together. And in talking to customers, they want better, faster, cheaper, and they want something that works at cloud scale. If you look at what we've done with LogScale, it's a much more modern version of a SIEM, a next-gen SIEM. We got ahead of the curve a couple of years ago when we bought Humio, which is now LogScale, we've now integrated into our platform, and it's extended out our XDR technology and it allows us to do log and SIEM in the same platform. So, from our perspective, the feedback that we've gotten not only from customers but partners like EY, who are building practices around this, this is a massive opportunity for CrowdStrike, and now is the right time for us, given the level of dissatisfaction M&A in the environment and the customer's willingness to look for a much better solution, which also gives us data gravity in the platform.
Saket Kalia: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, please standby, comes from the line of Joel Fishbein of Truist.
Joel Fishbein: Thanks for taking my question, and a good quarter on the net new ARR side. George, another question along Saket's lines, but around the comments you made with regard to data protection. The same could be said about the legacy DLP market. And as you know, I would say that's even longer in the tooth than some of the SIEM market players out there. Love to hear how you are -- you didn't talk about it like you did cloud security, identity protection, LogScale, et cetera. How far are we in that displacement market? And how big do you think they are? And what's the competitive dynamics there would be really helpful. Thank you.
George Kurtz: Sure. Well, we actually showed our data protection technology at Fal.Con a couple of months ago. We're actively working with some of the largest enterprises in the world to make sure that we account for all their requirements and their ability to actually move off their legacy DLP product. There's not one customer that I've talked to that says they like their DLP product, period. And in today's environment, with data in motion, particularly through cloud services, the ability to actually be able to track from endpoint through cloud where data moves, what type of data is out there, leveraging our AI to understand, is it something that should be moving in certain places is going to be incredibly important. And the way we look at it is the same way we looked at legacy AV. There's a better way to reimagine DLP into Falcon Data Protection, and we're very, very close to being able to release that as we continue to put the fine touches on what customers are looking for and what they're willing to write a check for. So stay tuned, but another massive market opportunity for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler.
Rob Owens: Great. Good afternoon. George, I guess staying on theme here with these extensible adjacencies, maybe you can touch on Falcon for IT. What early response has been since, I guess, showing it at your recent user conference and where you see the opportunity on that front?
George Kurtz: Well, coming out of Falcon, I would say that was the number one requested feedback item across all the great announcements that we had. I think it's so overdue in the technology space to be able to unify IT and security. Sometimes the technology isn't the harder part, it's the org structure. So, having a single agent that both security and IT can use, a home for IT, I think is very important. We're actually working with large customers right now, gathering their feedback, and then we'll look to have a product out probably in Q1. But so far the feedback has been amazing in terms of what we've already delivered, and now we're capturing additional capabilities for our first release. So, I think that one has a lot of legs to it, and certainly opens up a massive TAM opportunity for us in IT, well beyond anything in security, given the agent cloud architecture that we built. We've got the real estate and we plan to monetize it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC.
Matthew Hedberg: Great, thanks for taking my question. Burt, I've got one for you. Obviously, you didn't comment on fiscal '25. I believe at this point last year, you did give a couple of breadcrumbs on how to think about ARR. I'm curious as we as we sort of sharpen our pencils on '25, are there any guidepost or things that we should think about whether its growth or profitability?
Burt Podbere: Hey, Matt. Great question. So for us, we are always looking to maximize our growth while at the same time paying attention to the bottom-line. So that's never changed. We are absolutely going to continue to invest in innovation. We got -- we announced so much at our last Fal.Con. We've got a lot of momentum. We're going to continue to invest to continue that momentum. But also at the same time, we recognize that we want to make sure that we're a very well-run company and people are seeing the output of that certainly on this quarter and we don't plan on changing that at all for next year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Guggenheim.
John DiFucci: Thank you. George, it's impressive to really see the consistency of your team at scale here. But I'm just curious, how did traction continue into the end of the October quarter and then again into -- we're almost through November, relative to the October period. And the reason I'm asking this is that, we've generally heard of a fade in business activity through October across the industry, not necessarily with you, I mean, actually we didn't hear with you, but across most others. And it's actually sort of shown up in results of some of your security peers. So, I'm just wondering, maybe -- what are you seeing. What did you see into the end of the quarter? And what are you seeing at the beginning of the January period?
George Kurtz: Yeah, we certainly had a strong October. I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, the macro environment is still challenging. I mean, make no mistake about that. Deals take longer, a lot more scrutiny, a lot of sign offs, and there's a lot more work that goes into these larger enterprise deals. Getting deals done even like Falcon Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX), which are more enterprise-like in their nature, takes time. So, we had a great October, but in general, buyers are still cautious. And I think the fact that we're able to provide a real platform play that allows them to consolidate in other technologies and ultimately save money accrues values to us, but it certainly takes a lot of time and effort to get the deal over the goal line. But the team did a great job and October was strong for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America.
Tal Liani: Hi, guys. The first question is Bionic contribution, you said was de minimis. Can you define what de minimis for net new -- the contribution to net new ARR? And then, quarter was phenomenal, but I do see some weakness across the board of cyber companies with billings. In your case, it was down about 2%. I also see some weakness in deferred revenues. How do I reconcile what I see with billings, with deferred, with the underlying drivers that are very strong and your strong execution? Why is -- why are we seeing weakness not just with you, maybe with the entire space, but why are we seeing weakness with billings across the board? Thanks.
Burt Podbere: Thanks, Tal. Good question. I'm going to start with billings. Yeah, you're correct. For us specifically, we don't manage the business to billings and we feel that ARR gives you the absolute best proxy to revenue and we felt that that's the right metric, as you know, since we went public, to give you more transparency into the health of our business. And that's the metric that really guides you on health. With respect to billings ourselves, I mean, we think about billings similar to probably most of you out there, is that billings, typically for hardware companies, use that when they don't disclose any sort of bookings metric, and that's not us, right. We think that billings has certain things that just are not as relevant as a metric like ARR. You're comparing a balance sheet item to a P&L item. For us, the P&L is going to dictate the health of the business. So for us, you know, billings obviously is going to be impacted by duration and there are many things that go into that. And remember also that when you think about on a year-on-year basis, we're still up on billings. And I think that's the one thing that you want to take away. For us, when we think about how we want to continue to be transparent, ARR really gives you that notion of where we're going and how we're doing. And I think that that's the focus. And it has been, by the way, since we went public, even as a private company, that's the one that we manage the business to, that's how we look at how to give out quotas to our reps, et cetera, et cetera. So for us, that's not going to change. And I hope that answers that question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel.
Adam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just for George on CNAPP, it's obviously great to hear the traction. As we look ahead, should we still view this more of an upsell opportunity to existing customers or what needs to happen for this to be more of a tip of spear to drive net new logos? Thanks so much.
Maria Riley: I'm sorry, would you mind repeating your question?
Adam Borg: Great, can you hear me okay now?
Maria Riley: Yeah, I can -- we can hear you now.
Adam Borg: Great. Sorry about that. Maybe just on CNAPP, it's great to see the continued traction there. And as the market matures, should we view this as more of an upsell opportunity or what needs to happen for this to be more of a tip of spear to drive net new logos?
George Kurtz: Yeah, it's really a bright star for us when you look at our CNAPP capabilities of cloud workload protection, CSPM, CIEM, ASPM now with Bionic. We really have, I think one of the most complete cloud security offerings in the industry, and we're winning deals with it. We're leading, in many cases, particularly forward-leaning cloud companies that we're selling to. If you look at the latest threat environment and what's happening and how identities are being abused and two-factor authentication systems being bypassed, those sort of things, it's important to have a full suite of cloud protection. And I think this is sort of the awakening time for that industry and that companies can't just say, hey, we've got something from a cloud provider or we're going to go at it alone. I remember many, many, many years ago, companies didn't run antivirus, right? And you would say that's silly. Today, everybody runs an antivirus-type technology. It wasn't so silly 30, 35-plus years ago. And I think this is kind of the inflection point in the cloud world, where you're going to have multiple levels of protection, both agent and agentless. And the fact that we've been able to harmonize those two together and deliver a very robust agentless technology combined with the best cloud workload protection in the industry gives us a real advantage.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuity.
Michael Walkley: Great. Thanks. George, you touched on the new release of Falcon Go to better target SMB customers with more concise packaging. Can you just give us some color on how this segment of your business is trending, as some of your competitors have called out soft SMB spending due to the macro? And also, just how is this new release helping address pain points for these smaller customers? It seems like you're starting to accelerate win rates in this segment.
George Kurtz: Well, we saw a very strong SMB segment. We've done a lot of work, A, starting with our partners like Pax8 and others, Dell (NYSE:DELL), in that market. So meeting the customers, where they like to buy is really, really important. And then, coming up with a very innovative and easy-to-use technology designed for the SMB, our latest release of Falcon Go is literally one-click install. And the feedback that we've gotten from customers are like, ""Wow, this is the easiest thing I've seen. It just works."" And I think you're going to see even more broad adoption because we've made it so easy to install. You don't have to be an IT professional. And then, we've got our partner network that are building services around it. So they're able to generate dollars. We're able to sell our product through their channels where they meet the customers. And I think we've taken a very innovative and effective approach in our partnering strategy. This is something that we've really worked on over the last year, 18 months, and we're bearing the fruit of it right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell of BTIG.
Gray Powell: Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. Yeah, I was just wondering if you could repeat the commentary on the potential for a year-end budget flush. I think you said that it was not going to be a typical year. And if I remember correctly, last year, the commentary is more like there's going to be little or no budget flush. So, I guess my question is like how does this year look in comparison? Is it better, same, worse? Just sort of what's your confidence level on trends?
George Kurtz: I think we're looking at it saying, it may not happen, right. So, we're not necessarily counting on that. And if it does happen, fantastic. And you have to again keep in mind that our fiscal year end is the beginning of a new budget cycle as well. So, we have year-end budget if it comes in December and then new budgets in January. But we -- the macro environment, I would say has remained steady. As I said earlier, it's still challenging and we'll see if a budget flush comes, but that's not something that we're counting on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho of William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to get a little bit more color around the Charlotte AI revenue potential and maybe what customer use cases are seeing the most interest so far? Thank you.
George Kurtz: Well, we announced our pricing at Fal.Con. That was actually well received with customers. And in terms of the overall used cases, as I've talked about in the past, really it's helping a Tier 1 SOC analyst up level themselves to be a Tier 3, right? It's really driving SOC automation, which is a big focus for us with things like Charlotte and things like Falcon Foundry, how do you drive automation into organizations to give them better outcomes. At the end of the day, they would be willing to pay for something if it's going to save them time or money or make their job easier. And what we've seen in the customers who are using Charlotte right now in its preview mode is, they're able to do things way faster than they ever could and they're able to explore and ask questions that they haven't been able to do in the past, right? It just makes it so easy to have Charlotte gather up all the information and then take an action on their behalf. So, A, the pricing has resonated well with customers. We'll see how it shakes out as we get into full swing of things. But overall, what we've put together and the fact that it isn't an independent chatbot, it's really a foundational platform service that's wired into everything that we do and allows automation through all the modules, I think is a home run for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz of Mizuho.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you for taking the question. George, in your prepared remarks, you expressed a lot of excitement for Falcon for IT. But in addition to better security, better unification with IT, it also strikes me as having the potential to be a real ROI-driven sale for many customers. Do you agree with that? And if so, is that going to be an angle that you really go after from a go-to-market standpoint?
George Kurtz: Well, it's exactly what we're hearing from customers. I was with a customer last night and they were saying, we're so excited for Falcon for IT, because we've got to work. We find the problems, we document them, and then we've got to work with the IT teams to get them fixed, and a lot of times their tooling is well behind what we can do with Falcon, and they sort of end up fixing it themselves with IT because we just have the capabilities to do that. So, to be able to carve out a home for IT and seamlessly help them understand their exposures on their assets that matter and then drive the automation to actually remediate those is incredible. And it goes beyond just kind of simple remediation. If you think about all the internal use cases in HR, an employee might have an issue, they might have to investigate it, they might have to do forensics on systems. Systems are remote all over the world. We've got many, many airlines that use our technology. They don't want to send out an IT person to go fix a kiosk that has a Microsoft blue screen. So what can they do? They can use Falcon for IT to bring it back to health. Tremendous savings in terms of cost and travel and complexity. So this one, I'm really, really excited about. And again, we're working to get all the components of what customers need, at least for this first release. And then, I think sort of the sky is the limit of what we can build out there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: Good evening. Thank you. George and Burt, I have a question for you. As you think about your fiscal year '25 planning assumptions. You mentioned a couple of times that the macro environment is very consistent. Clearly, the execution on growth and profitability is very consistent. I'd love your observations on what's incrementally changing. Meaning, as you think about your priorities into next year, what's new versus this time last year? Thank you.
George Kurtz: Well, I'll start and then I'll let Burt jump in. I think from a priority perspective just on go-to-market and product-related. You talk about the fiscal piece, Burt. But we continue to drive innovation. Our focus has been on innovation, not integration. And I think that's shown in what we've been able to deliver in the market, how fast we've been able to come out with products. Falcon was our richest release of technology. So, we want to continue to be the innovation leader in security, and I think customers will recognize that. From a go-to-market perspective, there's a lot of work that we've done in terms of really, really making sure we've got the right hygiene across the enterprise and making sure that we can compress these, basically, time in sales cycles to get deals done when we need to and vector them in, and then also as we go down market into SMB, creating the right products for that segment and then delivering it through the right channels. So, what we have is working. So, it's going to continue to drive innovation, continue to remove friction in go-to-market motion, and continue operational excellence up and down the sales and the partner organization. Burt?
Burt Podbere: Thanks, George. So, in terms of how we think about the macro next year, we're not going to predict the change in the macro until we actually see it, right? I think that's going to be the wait-and-see game for most companies and that's certainly the one that we're going to take, but that's how I see it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham.
Alex Henderson: Great. Thank you so much. Thanks for a great print. But I was hoping you could give us some clarity around some of the key metrics that people use to track conditions, closure rates, whether they're stable, improving or eroding cycle time. I know you've said your deal size is up and I think at Fal.Con you talked about a significant increase in pipeline build. I think the comment was made on the stage that your pipeline target that they had tried to build was more than doubled the target. So, I was hoping you could talk about what the pipeline looks like as we go into this quarter and into the new year.
George Kurtz: Great. Well, when we look at the current macro environment, it is stable. But as I talked about in the Q&A and in the prepared remarks, it's still a challenging environment, it takes a lot of effort to get deals done. And again, it depends on the segments. Some segments are going to be a little bit longer in the enterprise and SMB a little bit shorter. But that being said, when we look out and we look at things like our pipeline, we have a record pipeline and we have that because I think we've got the best product suite in the industry. We've got customers that are truly understanding the platform capabilities of what we've built. They're coming to us and saying, ""Hey, let's sit down and go through your roadmap and our roadmap and let's figure out what we can consolidate."" So, they're coming to us with the openness of wanting to buy more and leveraging things like Falcon Flex to be able to have bigger commits at CrowdStrike, which is important. And overall, it's, as I said, still a tough environment. But I think we've got some key metrics like the pipeline that is encouraging to us. And when you look at LogScale and our cloud business and our identity business, I mean, these are absolutely bright stars across the entire platform. And again, keep in mind, we're not selling individual piece parts. People are buying the platform and that's what's driving the growth.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Eric Heath: Great. Thanks for fitting me in here. George, I guess I'll come back to the SIEM conversation. So, appreciate the color on the synergies of using LogScale to do the analytics on top of your first-party data that you're already capturing, makes a ton of sense. But I guess, can you flush out a bit more as to why your AI engine and your proprietary endpoint data is a better approach to capture the next-gen SIEM opportunity that many seem to be targeting, including those that claim to have more first-party data sources?
George Kurtz: Well, when you look at just kind of the data gravity and what customers care about, from a security perspective, I would say 85% of really the value of the data and the data that's generated comes from the endpoint. That really is the richest source of data because that's where it's generated from. As it goes across the network, it gets down-selected and you lose a lot of the fidelity. So, we already have a lot of that data. So let's start there. Then, when you look at LogScale, LogScale is very robust. It has the capabilities to ingest just about any type of third-party data into the product and very effectively without creating an index, which is its unique capabilities, index-free ingestion, which means you get immediate results. So, from a platform perspective, we sort of have the data gravity already. We've got that 85% of the data. So customers would rather give us 15% that we don't have and leverage LogScale to replace their SIEM. And beyond replacing their SIEM, that's the security use case, we have customers -- many, many customers that use it for all kinds of performance management, logging their infrastructure, logging their Kubernetes clusters. So, when you combine the fact that we're coming out with Falcon for IT, now with LogScale, which can log any data above and beyond security, we think that's a much broader opportunity than just SIEM itself. It opens up the entire data architecture of an organization to CrowdStrike.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to George Kurtz for closing remarks. Sir?
George Kurtz: Well, thank you. And I first want to close by acknowledging the heroic dedication of our team in Israel, who continue to remain focused on CrowdStrike's mission. Our thoughts are with each and every one of you in these trying times of war. Thanks all of you for your time today. We appreciate your interest and look forward to seeing you at our upcoming investor event and happy holidays.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

At a conference in Las Vegas, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) Chief Executive Adam Selipsky announced Trainium2, the second generation of chip designed for training AI systems. Selipsky said the new version is four times as fast as its predecessor while being twice as energy efficient. The AWS move comes weeks after Microsoft announced its own AI chip called Maia. The Trainium2 chip will also compete against AI chips from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, which has offered its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) to its cloud computing customers since 2018. Selipsky said that AWS will start offering the new training chips next year. The proliferation of custom chips comes amid a scramble to find the computing power to develop technologies such as large language models that form the basis of services similar to ChatGPT. The cloud computing firms are offering their chips as a complement to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the market leader in AI chips whose products have been in short supply for the past year. AWS also on Tuesday said that it will offer Nvidia's newest chips on its cloud service. 
Selipsky on Tuesday also announced Graviton4, the cloud firm's fourth custom central processor chip, which it said is 30% faster than its predecessor. The news comes weeks after Microsoft announced its own custom chip called Cobalt designed to compete with Amazon's Graviton series. Both AWS and Microsoft are using technology from Arm Ltd in their chips, part of an ongoing trend away from chips made by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in cloud computing.

But the headwinds from gaming may fade ahead of the new game console cycle, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and   Sony   (NYSE:SNE) expected to launch new consoles late next year.
Looking ahead, AMD will likely benefit from continuing notebook traction and a ramp-up in demand for desktop and server equipment in 2020, Rosenblatt suggested.

"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tech-earnings-roundup:-amazon,-microsoft,-alphabet-beat-earnings-478260","Apr 27, 2017","Investing.com – A quick look at quarterly earnings from three heavyweight tech companies that reported performance Thursday, after U.S. markets closed.
Amazon closes in on $1,000 mark. 
Shares of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rallied more than 4% to $961.00 in afterhours trade on Thursday, after the e-commerce giant posted earnings that beat on both the top and bottom line.
Amazon reported earnings of $1.47 per share on $35.71 billion in revenue, which was far above analysts’ expectations of earnings of $1.12 per share on $35.30 billion in revenue.
Amazon Web Services, the cloud service platform, continued to post strong growth, as revenue rose to $2.7 billion from $2.6 billion in the previous quarter.
Meanwhile, a slowdown in operating income to $1 billion, down 6%, was one one the few areas of concern.
Alphabet is all about alpha
Google’s parent company, Alphabet reported earnings of $7.73 per share on $24.75 billion in revenue, compared to analysts’ expectations of $7.39 per share on $24.22 billion in revenue. 
Advertising revenues, which forms a large chunk of Alphabet’s overall revenues, rose $21.4 billion during the quarter, up from around $18 billion in the previous year.
Alphabet’s better than expected quarterly report came amid concerns that ad-revenues were set for a slowdown, after a number of companies pulled their ads from Alphabet’s YouTube platform.
Meanwhile Alphabet’s 'Other Bets' category, which includes smart home brand Nest and self-driving company Waymo, revealed strong performance, as revenue rose to $244 million for the quarter, up from $165 million in the previous year.

https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/u.s.-intel-expert-says-russians--39;weaponized-39;-e-mail-leaks-450653,"Jan 01, 2017","Investing.com -- The rhetorical war between the Washington establishment, and President-elect Donald Trump, over disputed Russian hacking allegations, is heating up, with one leading Democratic intelligence expert claiming on Sunday that Moscow had ""weaponized"" the shameful e-mails of the Hillary Clinton campaign by leaking them to the media during last year's election campaign.
Trump had claimed in remarks to reporters on New Year's Eve that ""no computer is safe"" from hackers and that ""hacking is a hard thing to prove."" The remarks were in response to questions about the White House expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. last week over the hacking scandal.
The president-elect added, that he ""knows things that other people don't know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation. You'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday"" after his next briefing by the CIA.
The commonsense remarks touched off an incindiary response from a leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee during a TV appearance on Sunday morning.
""They didn't just steal data; they weaponized it,"" said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), on ABC's This Week program. ""They dumped it during an election with the specific intent of influencing the outcomes of that election and sowing discord in the U.S. That's not something that China has ever done.""
The e-mail messages provided insight into the Clinton team's mindset, its disdain of certain blocs of voters, and the text of many of Mrs. Clinton's speeches to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and other investment banks on her vision for a borderless North and South America. 
Most interestingly, The Washington Post picked up the ""weaponizing"" meme, and claimed online on Sunday that the president-elect was making it more difficult for U.S. intelligence agencies to detect hackers with his attitude and that hackers would be emboldened by his stance. The publication also claims that Trump's posture toward the Russian hacking allegations could harm U.S. national security.
The U.S. private sector, according to one recent report, is projected to spend $1 trillion from 2017 to 2021 dealing with cyberthreats, and companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others, earn significant revenues from cyber security software, hardware and consulting. The U.S. government budget for cyber-software is approximately $100 million per year.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied that the Russian government hacked the free Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) e-mail service, G-Mail, of Clinton advisor John Podesta, and has not retaliated for the Obama administration's sanctions last week for the purported shenanigans.",-0.6167

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/moody-39;s-downgrades-finland-39;s-credit-rating-from-triple-a-to-aaa-406491,"Jun 03, 2016","Investing.com -- Finland had its long-term issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings downgraded from Triple-A to Aaa on Friday by analysts at Moody's Investors Service, as the nation confronts considerable economic challenges and soft growth prospects in the years ahead.
In issuing its decision, Moody's said Finland's ability to withstand shocks from major structural changes to its economy has waned due to long-term projections of weak growth for the Scandinavian nation. While Finland's economy has shown some signs of rebounding in recent months, Moody's warned that Finland's planned reforms will do little to drive growth over the next five years. By one estimate, Moody's forecasts that Finland's average annual growth during a 10-year period through 2019 will reach 0.8%, far below the near 2% level of its Aaa-rated peers during the span.
The downgrade came hours after the Finnish government announced that the nation's GDP expanded at a rate of 0.6% during the first quarter, marking a considerable acceleration from the fourth quarter of 2015. It also represented the strongest increase in Finnish economic growth on a quarterly basis in five years. Analysts expected to see an increase of 0.4% for the three-month period.
Concurrently, Moody's reaffirmed the government's short-term rating of P-1, while raising its short-term outlook from negative to stable. In spite of the broad structural issues facing the economy, Moody's said Finland's credit profile remains strong due to the nation's highly educated workforce and the government's substantial holdings of financial assets.
In March, Fitch lowered Finland's credit rating from AAA+ to AA+, as finance minister Alexander Stubb expressed significant concerns on the economy's ability to ""reform itself."" Finland, home to telecommunications giant Nokia (HE:NOKIA), has been hit hard by the rise of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone and the Android in recent years. Last year, Nokia finished with annual revenue of €23.22 billion, down by more than 50% from the company's net sales in 2007. In April, 2014, Nokia completed the sale of its mobile phone business to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as part of a €5.44 billion deal.
The Finnish economy has also struggled due to the prolonged commodity rout and the recession suffered by Russia, one of its top trade partner. Finland ranked fifth in the world in exporting paper in 2014 ($9.4 billion), representing 5.4% of all paper exports worldwide.
Last September, Stubb described Finland as the ""sick man of Europe,"" after its GDP growth for the previous quarter ranked second-lowest among countries in the euro zone. Finland has the eighth-largest economy in Europe and the fifth-highest GDP per capita.",0.8316

This was its reply:  ""Thank you for the birthday wishes! However, it's important to note that as a computer program, I don't have feelings or consciousness, so I don't experience emotions like humans do."" Still, its uncannily human-like responses have taken the world by storm in the past year. And while it has answered millions of user prompts, its growing influence has raised questions about the role of AI in society.  Its parent, OpenAI, was also jolted this month by a tumultuous boardroom battle that saw the sudden ouster and return of CEO Sam Altman. ChatGPT became the fastest-growing software application in the world within six months of its launch. It also sparked the launch of rival chatbots from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and a bevy of startups that tapped the hype to secure billions in funding. The generative AI craze has disrupted several industries from cloud computing and customer service to movie editing and screenplay writing. Here are four charts on ChatGPT and the impact of generative AI: CHATGPT DOMINATES DESPITE RISE OF COMPETITORS ChatGPT's competitors include Bard, Anthropic's Claude, Character.AI and Microsoft's CoPilot, which have seen a surge in users. ChatGPT, however, commands the lion's share of the market.

IBM rose 2% after quarterly revenue beat analysts' expectations as the enterprise technology company's shift to high-growth areas such as cloud-based services begins to yield results.
IBM also stood by its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings of at least $13.50 per share, dispelling any concerns about the impact from Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
Johnson & Johnson jumped 3% after the diversified healthcare company reported a 3.9% increase in second-quarter sales, helped by strength in its pharmaceuticals business.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/the-week-ahead:-5-things-to-watch-on-the-economic-calendar-506051,"Jul 16, 2017","Investing.com - In the week ahead, global financial markets will focus on the outcome of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting for fresh clues on when the central bank will shift away from its ultra-easy policy.
Investors will also pay close attention to a monetary policy decision due in Japan amid speculation the Bank of Japan will lag well behind major global central banks in dialing back its massive stimulus program.
Elsewhere, China is to release what will be closely watched growth data amid recent signs of cooling in the world's second biggest economy.
In the U.K., market participants will be looking ahead to a report on consumer price inflation for further hints on the strength of the economy and the likelihood of the Bank of England raising interest rates this year.
Traders will also eye data on the U.S. housing sector to gauge the strength of the world's largest economy and how it will impact the Federal Reserve's view on monetary policy.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. European Central Bank policy meeting
The European Central Bank's latest interest rate decision is due at 1145GMT (7:45AM ET) on Thursday, with no big changes expected.
Most of the focus will be on President Mario Draghi's press conference 45 minutes after the announcement, as investors look for more clues on when and how the ECB could scale back its massive quantitative easing program.
Market experts believe the central bank is likely to wait until September before announcing a tapering of its 60 billion euros of monthly asset purchases.
Besides the ECB, market participants will be focusing on Tuesday's ZEW survey data on German economic sentiment to gauge confidence in the euro zone's largest economy.
2. Bank of Japan monetary policy decision
The Bank of Japan is not expected to make any changes to its monetary policy at the conclusion of its two-day rate review on Thursday, as robust exports and private consumption heighten prospects of a moderate economic expansion.
According to sources, the Japanese central bank is likely to upgrade its economic assessment but cut its rosy inflation outlook, reinforcing expectations it will lag well behind major global central banks in dialing back its massive stimulus program.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a press conference afterward to discuss the decision. He is likely to remind markets of the BOJ's resolve to maintain its ultra-easy policy until inflation is sustainably above 2%.
In addition, investors will focus on monthly trade data due Thursday, which could show Japanese exports rising for a seventh consecutive month.
3. China Q2 GDP
China is scheduled to release data on second quarter gross domestic product at around 0200GMT on Monday (10:00PM ET Sunday).
The report is expected to show the world's second largest economy grew 6.8% in the three months ended June 30, tempering initial worries of a sharper slowdown as Beijing walks a policy tightrope with its quest to crackdown on financial risks and limit damage to the economy.
The Asian nation will also publish data on June industrial production, fixed asset investment and retail sales along with the GDP report.
4. U.K. inflation figures
The U.K. Office for National Statistics will release data on consumer price inflation for June at 0830GMT (4:30AM ET) on Tuesday. Analysts expect consumer prices to rise 2.9%, the highest level in nearly four years.
The recent surge in inflation, caused largely by the plunge in sterling following last year's Brexit vote, has prompted some Bank of England policymakers to call for higher interest rates in the months ahead.
Besides the inflation report, the ONS will produce data on June retail sales on Thursday, with analysts expecting an increase of 0.4%.
Recent data has pointed to signs that rising inflation is crimping spending by consumers, the main drivers of the economy, just as the country is set to start EU divorce negotiations.
5. U.S. housing data
The Commerce Department is to publish a report on housing starts and building permits for June at 8:30AM ET (1230GMT) on Wednesday. The data could show that permits rose 3.0% to 1.200 million last month, while housing starts are forecast to gain 5.8% to 1.150 million.
Besides the housing data, this week's calendar also features surveys on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia and New York regions as well as weekly jobless claims.
Dovish comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen last week combined with soft inflation data saw investors temper their expectations for tighter monetary policy in the months ahead. Futures traders are pricing in around a 40% chance of a rate hike by the end of the year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
In addition to the data, this also marks the first big week of the second-quarter earnings season, with blue chips Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) among some of the names reporting results this week.
Headlines from Washington regarding President Donald Trump's health-care plan will also be in focus.

The dividend is payable on December 10, 2015 to shareholders of record on November 19, 2015, while the ex-dividend date will be on November 17, 2015, the company said in a statement. Over the last four quarters, Microsoft has paid a dividend of 0.31, up from 0.28 during each quarter in 2014. A year earlier, the company paid out a dividend of 0.23 a share during Fiscal Year 2013. As of mid-April, the tech giant had more than 8.089 million shares outstanding.
The quarterly dividend increase represents one of the company's largest over the last decade. For a five-year period from 2004 through 2008, Microsoft increased its quarterly dividend by one cent on an annual basis. In the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2009, the Redmond, Washington-based company boosted its quarterly dividend by two cents from 0.11 to 0.13. Quarterly dividends remained unchanged in 2010, before rising by three cents a year later and by four cents in 2012. Microsoft decreased quarterly dividends back to 0.03 in 2013 before raising them back by 0.05 in the first quarter of Fiscal Year of 2014.
The announcement comes one day after reports surfaced that Microsoft could launch its Surface Pro 4, as well as two other handsets at a media event in New York on October 6. On Tuesday, Microsoft gained 0.94 or 2.14% to close at 43.98, ending the day as one of the top performers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Salesforce.com chief executive Marc Benioff is looking to make a “splashy acquisition” and has touted Twitter as an “unpolished jewel” offering untapped potential advertising and data-rich applications, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal (WSJ).
Benioff is expected to have tough competition with the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) all reported to have shown interest in the company.

https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/u.s.-government-drops-legal-action-against-apple-in-san-bernardino-case-392196,"Mar 28, 2016","Investing.com -- The U.S. Department of Justice withdrew a criminal complaint against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Monday evening after the FBI reportedly retrieved information from the phone of a terrorist responsible for the San Bernardino attacks last fall without the help of the major technology company. 
According to court documents filed on Monday, the Justice Department said it ""no longer requires assistance from Apple, Inc."" mandated by a February court order, which compelled the company to provide support to federal agents in their investigation into a mass shooting in December that claimed the lives of 14 civilians. As part of the investigation, the Justice Department asked Apple to help the FBI unlock an iPhone 5c which belonged to Syed Farook, one of two shooters accused of perpetrating the attacks. 
The story was initially reported by USA Today on Monday evening. 
The Justice Department's actions came days after reports from Reuters surfaced that Cellebrite, an Israeli forensic software company, developed innovative decryption technology in order to gain access into Farook's phone. In the days since, officials from Cellebrite refused to confirm or deny the reports. Last week, attorneys from the Justice Department asked a U.S. federal court to delay a hearing after court filings indicated that an ""outside party"" developed the means to unlock the phone. 
The highly-publicized case has garnered significant media attention in recent weeks, reigniting a longstanding debate on the importance of individual privacy versus national security interests. Apple CEO Tim Cook lambasted the Justice Department for filing the suit, describing any order by the government that forced the company to develop software for hacking into its own technology as the ""software equivalent of cancer.""
Cook received the backing from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), as well as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc C (NASDAQ:GOOG), and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) in the controversial case. 
""While the government can in some circumstances require private parties to support law-enforcement investigations...law enforcement may not commandeer innocent third parties into becoming its undercover agents, its spies, or its hackers,"" the ACLU wrote in an amicus brief last month. ""If the government prevails, then this case will be the first of many requiring companies to degrade the security and to undermine the trust in their products so essential to privacy in the digital age.""

This sentiment arises from concerns over the sustainability of recent gains, particularly those driven by a small group of technology giants. David Noonan, a seasoned trader, exemplifies this cautious approach, having shifted to cash and short positions in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). This trend reflects a broader skepticism among investors about the market's reliance on key tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), collectively known as the 'magnificent seven.'
Recent market data underscores this cautious approach, with individual investors selling nearly $16 billion in stocks in October, marking the highest sell-off in two years. Even exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focusing on the tech sector, such as ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ), have experienced significant outflows. While some investors, like Gerardo Giusti, still view tech giants as viable long-term investments, their short-term prospects appear less certain. Giusti's current strategy includes diversifying into gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)), crypto (COIN), and cyclical sectors, while closely monitoring the Fed's interest rate decisions.
As the Fed signals a cautious approach to future rate hikes, optimism for rate cuts in 2024 has fueled recent stock surges. However, the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 presidential election and potential economic slowdown keeps traders like Giusti on alert for market shifts. On the other hand, Ashton Jones, a financial analyst and part-time trader, anticipates a year-end rally but is preparing for a pullback in January. His plan to short the market reflects a common sentiment among traders: while the market's current trajectory defies gravity, a correction seems inevitable, driven by profit-taking and seasonal patterns.
In summary, the current market scenario presents a complex picture for retail traders. While the stock rally has been strong, the heavy dependence on a few tech giants combined with potential economic headwinds and political uncertainties has prompted many to secure their gains and adopt a more defensive stance.

(NYSE:ORCL) has experienced a slight decline amid a landscape of fluctuating market movements. On Wednesday, the technology giant's shares dipped by a modest 0.03%, closing at $116.21. This marginal drop occurred against a backdrop of mixed market performance, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average inching up by 0.04%, while the S&P 500 saw a decline of 0.09%. This marks Oracle's second day in a row of stock price decreases.
Despite the recent dips, Oracle's current stock price stands robust when compared to its industry counterparts such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which closed at $378.85, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), which ended at $136.40. However, Oracle has yet to reclaim its June high of $127.54. Additionally, the company's trading volume has been notably lower than usual, trailing the 50-day average by more than 1 million shares.
Investors may be keeping a watchful eye on Oracle's performance as it navigates through the dynamic market conditions. While the company's recent stock movements have been relatively small, they are occurring within a broader context of market uncertainty where even minor changes can signal investor sentiment and broader economic trends.InvestingPro InsightsIn light of Oracle Corp.'s recent market activity, certain metrics from InvestingPro provide additional context for investors.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusivehow-suse-deviated-from-its-internal-controls-while-warning-about-sales-risk-3246554,"Nov 30, 2023","By Stefania Spezzati and Karin Strohecker LONDON (Reuters) - Software firm SUSE, whose clients include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and BMW (ETR:BMWG), told investors in January it was tightening its scrutiny of commercial deals.  SUSE, whose software helps large companies run servers, said in its annual report for 2022 that to ensure sales were ""appropriately authorized"" it had created a deal desk – a department commonly used by software businesses to vet commercial and contractual terms.  Founded in 1992, SUSE had been publicly traded since 2021 and creating a deal desk aligned it with other listed companies in the sector.  ""SUSE may enter into high-risk or commercially inappropriate deals if it does not exercise effective control over the Sales organization,"" it said in the report. The company noted that ""'Commercial governance' is a newly identified risk this year"" and a heatmap in the report ranked the risk as ""possible"" and its impact on the business as ""high"". Reuters wasn't able to establish what prompted that warning. Nine company  documents seen by Reuters relating to two of SUSE's recent sales, as well as interviews with  three people with knowledge of the transactions, shed light on some examples of the company's decision-making as it has tried to  tighten commercial controls. Lawyers for SUSE said in a letter to Reuters on Sept. 22 that the creation of the deal desk was ""nothing more than a natural governance maturity exercise, undertaken by a scaling and young listed business"".  SUSE's majority shareholder, EQT (ST:EQTAB), in August offered to take the software company private  after it slashed sales targets this year, its CEO and CFO departed, and its shares plunged. SUSE held an extraordinary meeting on Nov. 13 at which shareholders approved to delist the stock from the exchange.  ""Execution challenges and several changes during the past twelve months have impacted SUSE's operating performance and market valuation,"" EQT said in a statement on the public offer in August. It added that leaving the public stock market would ease pressure from ""short-term demands"" on the new management. EQT declined to comment for this article.  Its offer for SUSE shares, which were traded in Frankfurt, valued  SUSE  at 2.72 billion euros ($3 billion), some 47% below the level of the 2021 IPO. SUSE shares last traded at 10.89 euros on Nov. 13 before the delisting, according to the exchange Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1Gn), 64% below its IPO price.  SUSE's revenue in the financial year to October 31, 2022 was $653 million. Its 2022 annual report, filed on January 19,  said the deal desk should review any deals greater than $500,000. Lawyers for SUSE's former CEO Melissa Di Donato, who stood down on March 21, told Reuters the deal desk was created after a joint decision by the executive team and the company's board.  According to four documents reviewed by Reuters and two of the people with knowledge of the situation, Di Donato greenlighted the commercial terms of a roughly $1.4 million sale to South African utility Eskom in late January, bypassing the deal desk's scrutiny in order to speed the process, less than two weeks after SUSE told investors the desk would help to improve controls.  On January 30,  after commercial terms of the Eskom deal had been agreed, a senior SUSE executive said in an email to other company officials that the terms had not been submitted to the deal desk.  In late February, an executive told colleagues in an email that the sale had not been scrutinized by the deal desk before being agreed but the team would review the terms to familiarize itself with the transaction, according to the documents and two people with knowledge of the transaction.  The deal would still be logged into SUSE's systems as approved by Di Donato without sign-off from the deal desk, the executive said. Reuters could not determine if this was done. There was no suggestion in the documents reviewed by the news agency of any problematic issues that arose from the terms of the deal.  A lawyer for Di Donato said in the letter to Reuters that it was ""highly misleading"" to suggest she had reached the Eskom agreement without submitting it for the deal desk's approval: ""the deal desk was aware of the deal. Nothing was skipped."" SUSE lawyers didn't address directly whether approval from the deal desk had been skipped on the Eskom transaction.  A spokesperson for Eskom did not comment on SUSE's due diligence but said that ""Eskom's established processes and governance structures were adhered to during this procurement.""  DISCOUNTED DEAL  As part of the new risks identified in the annual report, SUSE warned in January that: ""quarter-end pressure may exacerbate the risk as sales staff try to get deals over the line."" The documents  reviewed by Reuters show the efforts SUSE made to  clinch one deal: in December 2022 SUSE discounted a sale to Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) by more than 90% from the listed price.   SUSE sales growth was slowing at the time. Di Donato agreed to offer BNY Mellon the discount on a package of services originally listed at several million dollars, according  to emails and a person familiar with the transaction. Reuters could not determine what SUSE's original offer was.  Under the discounted deal, BNY Mellon was offered a one-year package that included  SUSE's Platinum service and 10,000 'nodes', according to the documents and one of the people. Lawyers for Di Donato said ""the scope, the services and the size of the BNY Mellon deal changed from what was originally on offer and, therefore, the final price changed accordingly."" Di Donato's lawyer added ""it was not part of her responsibilities as the CEO of SUSE to track discounts on deals,"" and ""the discount was approved in collaboration with others"". A spokesperson for BNY Mellon declined to comment on the deal.  Lawyers for SUSE did not comment on the terms of the deal, saying it was confidential. Reuters could not determine if the deal was vetted by the deal desk nor how many deals have been going through the unit.    Without referring to SUSE specifically, Christian Strenger, director of the Corporate Governance Institute (CGI) at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, said that software-related services companies, in particular, have pressure to meet quarterly and year-end performance targets as they often rely on large individual sales.  Di Donato's lawyers said that quarter-end pressures affected all companies: ""Our client has never forced a sales team to close a deal that was not good for the business."" SUSE and Reuters parent company,  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), are involved in litigation over the use of SUSE software products. SUSE claims that Thomson Reuters breached the terms that allegedly governed its use of SUSE software products.  ($1 = 0.9096 euros)",0.9492

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/the-week-ahead:-5-things-to-watch-on-the-economic-calendar-476487,"Apr 23, 2017","Investing.com - Europe is likely to set the tone for global financial markets this week, with the French presidential election and European Central Bank policy meeting on investors' minds.
Elsewhere, key U.S. economic reports this week should provide further evidence if the world’s largest economy is strong enough to withstand higher borrowing costs in the months ahead, with Friday's GDP data in the spotlight.
Meanwhile, in the U.K., market players will pay close attention to a first estimate of U.K. first quarter GDP for further signals on the continued effect that the Brexit decision is having on the economy.
Investors will also focus on a monetary policy decision due in Japan
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. French Presidential Election
The first round of the highly-anticipated French Presidential Election will be held on Sunday. Exit polls are expected to be released at 18:00GMT (2:00PM ET), with the final vote count due in early Europe on Monday.
Polls make centrist and pro-European candidate Emmanuel Macron the slight favorite. His three close rivals, according to voting surveys, are the anti-EU, anti-immigration National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who would dump the euro currency and return to national ones, far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, who wants France to rip up international trade treaties and quit NATO, and the conservative Francois Fillon, whose reputation has been sullied by a nepotism scandal.
The base case among many analysts is that Macron and Le Pen will emerge as winners in the first round of the election, with Macron likely to go on to win the second round run-off on May 7, but few experts dare rule out a shock result, especially with a large number of undecided voters.
Polls in the dying days of the campaign put all the candidates roughly on between a fifth and a quarter of the vote, with around five percentage points or less separating them, making the race too close to call.
Investors are fearful over the prospect of a second round run-off between euro skeptics Le Pen and Melenchon.
2. European Central Bank Policy Meeting
The European Central Bank's latest interest rate decision is due at 11:45GMT (7:45AM ET) on Thursday, with most not expecting any change in policy despite recent indications of robust growth and surging inflation.
Most of the focus will likely be on President Mario Draghi's press conference 45 minutes after the announcement. He will probably avoid any discussion about winding down asset buys, instead sticking to his stance that the recent surge in inflation is temporary, growth is fragile and political risks clouds the outlook, requiring stimulus.
A recent Reuters poll found that the ECB will stay in the background through upcoming elections in key European countries and is only likely to signal a shift away from its ultra-easy monetary policy toward early next year.
Besides the ECB, the euro zone will publish flash April inflation figures on Friday. The consensus forecast is that the report will show consumer prices rose 1.8%, accelerating from a gain of 1.5% in March. Core prices are expected to increase 1%, compared to 0.7% in the prior month.
Spain, France, Italy and Germany will produce their own CPI reports throughout the week.
3. U.S. Advanced 1st Quarter Growth Data
The U.S. is to release preliminary figures on first quarter economic growth at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT) Friday. The data is expected to show that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.1% in the first three months of 2017, easing from growth of 2.1% in the fourth quarter.
Besides the GDP report, this week's calendar also features U.S. data on consumer confidence, new home sales and durable goods orders.
A recent batch of disappointing data on employment, retail sales and inflation prompted market players to trim their bullish bets on the U.S. economy and push back expectations for two more hikes this year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Headlines from Washington regarding health care reform, tax cuts and a possible government shutdown will also be in focus.
On Friday, Trump promised a big announcement about tax reform and said he hoped to see a health care vote when Congress comes back in the coming days.



There are also about 190 S&P 500 companies reporting earnings this week, the biggest profit-reporting week in at least a decade. Thursday will be the busiest day with nearly 70 reports due, including updates after the closing bell from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).
4. U.K. Preliminary Q1 GDP Figures
The Office for National Statistics is to produce preliminary data on U.K. economic growth for the first quarter at 08:30GMT (4:30AM ET) on Friday.
The report is forecast to reveal the economy grew 0.4% in the January-March quarter, after expanding 0.7% in the preceding quarter, underlining worries that Britain's economy is slowing just as it prepares to start negotiations to leave the European Union.
On an annualized rate, the British economy is expected to grow 2.2% in the first quarter, up slightly from growth of 1.9% in the previous three-month period.
Recent data has pointed to signs that rising inflation is crimping spending by consumers, the main drivers of the economy, just as Prime Minister Theresa May begins Britain's EU divorce talks.
5. Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Decision
The Bank of Japan is seen keeping its short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1% when it releases its latest rate decision and monetary policy statement at around 03:00GMT Thursday (11:00PM ET Wednesday).
The central bank is also expected to hold the 10-year government bond yield target at around 0%, while maintaining the net amount of Japanese government bonds it buys annually at around 80 trillion yen, as it waits for more evidence of a modest economic recovery.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a press conference afterward to discuss the decision. Kuroda recently reiterated the central bank's resolve to maintain its massive monetary stimulus until inflation is stably above its 2%.

(NASDAQ:MSFT) navigates a pivotal moment with OpenAI, the tech giant is considering strategic options to bolster its artificial intelligence endeavors following Sam Altman's departure from OpenAI to join Microsoft. This move comes as the company aims to enhance its AI capabilities and maintain the growth of its ChatGPT subscriber base.
On Tuesday, speculation swirled regarding who might replace Altman at OpenAI, with Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, being a rumored candidate. However, these rumors were quashed when Amodei dismissed the idea of either stepping in as CEO or merging with OpenAI. Amid this leadership transition, investor unrest has surfaced, potentially leading to legal challenges against OpenAI's board.
Despite these developments and a slight dip in Microsoft's stock value earlier today, the company's shares remained stable after achieving a record high on Monday. Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, described Altman's move as a necessary step for governance reform at OpenAI and reassured that it does not jeopardize their long-term objectives. Nadella also suggested the possibility for OpenAI staff to join Microsoft's substantial AI division.
Analysts from Morgan Stanley highlighted Microsoft's delicate position with OpenAI, emphasizing the need to resolve executive conflicts or possibly integrate OpenAI's Research Lab into Microsoft. The focus remains on advancing Artificial General Intelligence research and securing the expansion of the ChatGPT subscriber base. Microsoft's development efforts include Azure OpenAI Services and products utilizing GPT technology.
Wall Street analysts have maintained a Strong Buy consensus on Microsoft stock after a significant rally, with projections indicating an average price target suggesting over 10% growth potential.

The previously unreported letter and AI algorithm were key developments before the board's ouster of Altman, the poster child of generative AI, the two sources said. Prior to his triumphant return late Tuesday, more than 700 employees had threatened to quit and join backer Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in solidarity with their fired leader. The sources cited the letter as one factor among a longer list of grievances by the board leading to Altman's firing, among which were concerns over commercializing advances before understanding the consequences. Reuters was unable to review a copy of the letter. The staff who wrote the letter did not respond to requests for comment.  After being contacted by Reuters, OpenAI, which declined to comment, acknowledged in an internal message to staffers a project called Q* and a letter to the board before the weekend's events, one of the people said. An OpenAI spokesperson said that the message, sent by long-time executive Mira Murati, alerted staff to certain media stories without commenting on their accuracy. Some at OpenAI believe Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup's search for what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks. Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*’s future success, the source said. Reuters could not independently verify the capabilities of Q* claimed by the researchers.  'VEIL OF IGNORANCE' Researchers consider math to be a frontier of generative AI development. Currently, generative AI is good at writing and language translation by statistically predicting the next word, and answers to the same question can vary widely. But conquering the ability to do math — where there is only one right answer — implies AI would have greater reasoning capabilities resembling human intelligence. This could be applied to novel scientific research, for instance, AI researchers believe. Unlike a calculator that can solve a limited number of operations, AGI can generalize, learn and comprehend. In their letter to the board, researchers flagged AI’s prowess and potential danger, the sources said without specifying the exact safety concerns noted in the letter. There has long been discussion among computer scientists about the danger posed by highly intelligent machines, for instance if they might decide that the destruction of humanity was in their interest. Researchers have also flagged work by an ""AI scientist"" team, the existence of which multiple sources confirmed. The group, formed by combining earlier ""Code Gen"" and ""Math Gen"" teams, was exploring how to optimize existing AI models to improve their reasoning and eventually perform scientific work, one of the people said. Altman led efforts to make ChatGPT one of the fastest growing software applications in history and drew investment - and computing resources - necessary from Microsoft to get closer to AGI. In addition to announcing a slew of new tools in a demonstration this month, Altman last week teased at a summit of world leaders in San Francisco that he believed major advances were in sight. 
""Four times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks, I've gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honor of a lifetime,"" he said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. A day later, the board fired Altman.  (Anna Tong and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco and Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Lisa Shumaker)",0.9668
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/openai-ceo-sam-altman-reinstated-in-strategic-win-for-microsoft-and-ai-industry-3241486,"Nov 22, 2023","Quiver Quantitative - In a stunning reversal, Sam Altman reclaims his position as CEO of OpenAI, signaling a significant turn in the tumultuous events that have gripped the artificial intelligence community. His reinstatement, following intense negotiations and considerable investor pressure, underscores Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategic victory and influence in the ongoing narrative of AI's commercialization and ethical development.
OpenAI, in a bold move, has restructured its board, introducing notable figures like Bret Taylor and Larry Summers, alongside Quora's Adam D’Angelo. Their appointment is seen as a strategic alignment with investor interests and Silicon Valley's elite, providing a stabilizing force after the whirlwind of leadership changes. Microsoft's stock, reacting to the news, soared to unprecedented levels, reflecting investor optimism in the wake of the organization's recalibration.
The reinstallation of Altman as CEO comes with the condition of an internal investigation into the circumstances leading to his initial dismissal. This development is a clear compromise designed to placate concerns around governance and operational transparency. As the dust settles, the focus shifts to the composition of the new board, with expectations of Microsoft's representation, indicating a closer intertwining of OpenAI's pioneering technology with Microsoft's expansive AI strategy.
Altman's return may quell investor unrest and mitigate the risk of talent attrition, yet it raises critical questions about the future trajectory of OpenAI. With the company at the intersection of rapid AI development and the need for substantial capital, the saga illuminates the complex dance between innovation, responsibility, and investment in the high-stakes world of technology startups.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/openai-ceos-ouster-brings-eu-regulatory-debate-into-focus-3239822,"Nov 21, 2023","By Martin Coulter and Supantha Mukherjee LONDON (Reuters) - As the European Union edges closer to passing a wide-ranging set of laws governing artificial intelligence, lawmakers and experts say the surprise ousting of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman underscores the need for strict rules.  Altman, cofounder of the startup that last year kicked off the generative AI boom, was abruptly fired by OpenAI’s board last week, sending shockwaves through the tech world and prompting employees to make threats of a mass resignation at the company.  Across the Atlantic, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Council have been hashing out the fine print of the AI Act, a sweeping set of laws that would require some companies to complete extensive risk assessments and make data available to regulators.  In recent weeks, talks have hit stumbling blocks over the extent to which companies should be allowed to self-regulate.  Brando Benifei, one of two European Parliament lawmakers leading negotiations on the laws, told Reuters: “The understandable drama around Altman being sacked from OpenAI and now joining Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shows us that we cannot rely on voluntary agreements brokered by visionary leaders.  “Regulation, especially when dealing with the most powerful AI models, needs to be sound, transparent and enforceable to protect our society.”  On Monday, Reuters reported that France, Germany and Italy had reached an agreement on how AI should be regulated, a move expected to accelerate negotiations at the European level. The three governments support ""mandatory self-regulation through codes of conduct"" for those using generative AI models, but some experts said this would not be enough.  Alexandra van Huffelen, Dutch minister for digitalisation, told Reuters the OpenAI saga underscored the need for strict rules. She said: “The lack of transparency and the dependence on a few influential companies in my opinion clearly underlines the necessity of regulation.” 
Meanwhile, Gary Marcus, an AI expert at New York University, wrote on social media platform X: ""We can’t really trust the companies to self-regulate AI where even their own internal governance can be deeply conflicted.  ""Please don't gut the EU AI Act; we need it now more than ever.""",0.9628

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/openai-microsoft-hit-with-new-author-copyright-lawsuit-over-ai-training-3240504,"Nov 21, 2023","By Blake Brittain (Reuters) -OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were sued on Tuesday over claims that they misused the work of nonfiction authors to train the artificial intelligence models that underlie services like OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT. OpenAI copied tens of thousands of nonfiction books without permission to teach its large language models to respond to human text prompts, said author and Hollywood Reporter editor Julian Sancton, who is leading the proposed class action filed in Manhattan federal court. The lawsuit is one of several that have been brought by groups of copyright owners, including authors John Grisham, George R.R. Martin and Jonathan Franzen, against OpenAI and other tech companies over the alleged misuse of their work to train AI systems. The companies have denied the allegations. Sancton's complaint is the first author lawsuit against OpenAI to also name Microsoft as a defendant. The company has invested billions of dollars in the artificial intelligence startup and integrated OpenAI's systems into its products. A spokesperson for OpenAI declined to comment on the Tuesday lawsuit, citing pending litigation. Representatives for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The complaint also said that Microsoft has been ""deeply involved"" in training and developing the models and is also liable for copyright infringement. Sancton asked the court for an unspecified amount of monetary damages and a court order to block the alleged infringement.",-0.9493

1. Yellen in the spotlight for hints on Fed rate hikes
Among of a slew of Federal Reserve (Fed) officials scheduled to speak on Tuesday, investors will focus on the Fed chair Janet Yellen who will give a speech to the Economic Club of New York at 15:30GMT, or 11:30AM ET.
Traders will be looking for any indication of the future path of rate hikes from the head of the U.S. central bank after a string of seemingly more hawkish comments by other Fed officials since the March policy decision.
San Francisco Fed president John Williams gave an upbeat outlook on the U.S. economy earlier on Tuesday and reiterated that future rate increases would be “gradual and thoughtful”.
After Yellen’s speech, New York Fed chief William Dudley and Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan will speak at 16:00GMT, or 12:00ET, and 17:00GMT, or 13:00ET, respectively.
2. Oil turns lower on fears of a correction and ahead of inventory data
Oil prices fell on Tuesday among fears that the rebound from February’s low has run its course with  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' analysts suggesting that the barrel of crude could return to near $30.
Concerns were also raised while waiting for inventory data which could show that U.S. stockpiles rose once again to record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly inventory data on Tuesday at 20:35GMT, or 16:35ET, while the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration will publish its report on Wednesday at 14:30GMT, or 10:30AM ET.

As the Japan’s parliament voted to pass the budget on Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the political body that he had no plans to delay a sales tax hike to 10%, from the current 8%, scheduled for next year unless the country is hit by a major financial shock.
Abe also said that he was “not at all” thinking of calling a snap election.
Both remarks contradicted expert forecasts, 18 out of 21 economists in a recent Reuters poll looking for the tax hike to be delayed beyond April 2016 and 15 who expect the snap election to be called.
4. BoE to give details on bank capital buffers
The Bank of England’s (BoE) Financial Policy Committee (FPC) will release the decisions made at its March 23 meeting which will determine if British banks will have to raise capital buffers.

Following the announcement, a number of mainstream media outlets suggested Starbucks might soon be accepting Bitcoin as one of the payment methods, which was quickly denied by Starbucks.

Corporate earnings will continue to weigh heavily on market direction amid a lack of top-tier economic data on the calendar for Friday.
Quarterly earnings from both General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) due Friday will likely garner the most attention amid a slew of earnings from several companies including Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, State Street, SunTrust Banks and others.
General Electric, which has undergone a revamp under the stewardship of CEO John Flannery, reports second-quarter results before market open.
General Electric is expected to report earnings of 17 cents a share on revenue of $29.23 billion.
The industrial conglomerate's guidance for full-year 2018 earnings will likely be closely scrutinized after the company said in its first-quarter earnings call that earnings per share (EPS) will likely trend toward the lower end of guidance.
GE's aviation segment will also warrant close attention as it was one of the main factors that supported profit growth in the first quarter.
General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stock closed 0.15% lower at $13.73.
Honeywell, meanwhile, is expected to report second-quarter earnings of $2.01 a share on revenue of $10.82 billion.
2. Will Microsoft Earnings, Revenue Beat Lift Nasdaq?
Shares of Microsoft rose modestly during afterhours trade, as the tech giant topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines amid double-digit revenue growth across all segments.
Microsoft reported earnings of $1.13 cents per share on $30.09 billion in revenue. That was above Wall Street estimates of $1.08 per share on revenue of $29.21 billion.
A uptick in its more personal computing segment boosted quarterly performance, as the segment saw revenue grow to $10.8 billion for the quarter, up 17% from the same period a year ago.
Microsoft’s cloud business continued to strengthen as Azure, a competitor of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, showed robust growth as product sales soared 89% for the quarter.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock rose 0.24% to $104.75 in afterhours trade.
3. US Rig Count Data; Oil Prices Recovery in Focus

Bitcoin fell 11.5% to $7,089.40, down from a high of $7,924 after rising above $8,000 earlier this week.
Bitcoin's meteroic six-week rise from around $4,000 level has left many expecting the popular crypto to suffer a market correction, with the relative strength index (RSI) flagging extremely overbought conditions with a near-90 reading earlier this week.
A reading above 70 usually indicates overbought conditions, while a reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions.
The plunge in Bitcoin has led to some bearish calls from analysts, with some suggesting that a 40% plunge to the $5,000 level could be the offing.
""As we’ve seen this kind of parabolic rise in price action, this would line up perfectly with previous lows,"" Nicholas Merten, a prominent crypto analyst, said. ""So as we go into the end of May and into early June, I would expect we’re going to come down here into this range and hold.""
Still, there are signs that the popular crypto is back in demand, with trading volumes over the past weekend hitting record highs of $30 billion, followed by $29 billion on Sunday, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-falls-after-another-crypto-ad-ban-1449727,"May 16, 2018","Investing.com - Cryptocurrencies continued to fall on Wednesday, after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced it is banning ads for virtual currencies and related products.
Bitcoin was trading at of $8,372.10, falling 4.65% as of 8:19 AM ET (12:19 GMT) on the Bitfinex exchange.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will join technology giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in banning advertisements of cryptocurrencies on its search engine, Bing. Digital coins are a risk to users because they are not regulated, the company said in a press release.
“To help protect our users from this risk, we have made the decision to disallow advertising,”  said Melissa Alsoszatai-Petheo, advertiser policy manager. The ban is expected to take effect in June.
While Facebook has opted to ban advertisements of digital coins, the social media site announced last week that it plans to develop its own cryptocurrency. David Marcus, who heads Facebook's Messanger app, will oversee a new unit looking into how the company can leverage blockchain technology.
Meanwhile on the regulation front, Ukraine is preparing legislation to legalize virtual currencies. The draft, which was posted on Facebook by Ukrainian parliament member Alexi Mushak, aims to create a “free and transparent” cryptocurrency market in Ukraine and includes measures to prevent its use for money laundering and other criminal activities.
Earlier in May the Ukrainian National Securities and Stock Market Commission said it would consider recognizing virtual coins as a financial instrument.
Other digital coins were also lower, with Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, falling 3.69% to $705.10 on the Bitfinex exchange.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/5-things-to-watch-on-the-economic-calendar-this-week-395978,"Apr 17, 2016","Investing.com - In the week ahead, market players will be focusing on the outcome of Sunday's meeting of top oil producers in Doha to discuss an output freeze aimed at shoring up oil prices.
Earnings will drive markets with reports expected from many blue-ship stocks while the U.S. is to release housing market data.
The European Central Bank will hold its interest rate decision on Thursday and the euro zone is to release data on private sector activity on Friday.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. Doha Oil Freeze Talks
Talks in Doha between some of the world’s major oil producers are expected to result in a draft accord on freezing output in a bid to stabilize the global market.
Saudi Arabia and Russia have approved a deal to freeze output at January levels until October 1 and other producers are expected to also do so.
Crude oil prices have rallied more than 30% since the proposed freeze was first put forward in February.
But analysts have cautioned that freezing production near current levels is unlikely to reduce the global supply glut.
2. Earnings
A slew of companies are to report results, including  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS), Alphabet, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Coca-Cola, Visa, and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE).
Analysts expect  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s first-quarter profit to have plunged in what is widely being considered the worst start to the year for the banking sector since the global financial crisis.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will kick off the earnings season for large U.S. drug makers.
3. U.S. housing data
The U.S. is to release housing sector data with reports on housing starts and building permits on Tuesday and data on existing home sales on Wednesday.
Housing starts are expected to have dropped to an annual pace of 1.170 million units in March from 1.178 million units in February.
Building permits are likely to have increased to a 1.2 million-unit rate last month.
Existing home sales are expected to have rebounded by 3.5% in March after dropping 7.1% in February.
4. ECB rate announcement
The ECB is to hold its next monetary policy meeting on Thursday, at which no further policy changes are expected.
Last month the bank unveiled a raft of new measures, including interest rate cuts, additional monthly bond purchases and more cheap loans to banks.
5. Euro zone PMIs
Markit is to publish its flash purchasing managers' index for the euro zone on Friday, which will indicate how the bloc's private sector has performed in April.
The data is expected to show that growth remained subdued but attention will be on the output price index for signs of inflationary pressure.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-things-under-the-radar-this-week-1904587,"Jun 22, 2019","Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Apple Has a Stealthy Month
Amazingly, Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) are having a great June, up more than 14%, tops among the 30 Dow stocks and sixth best among stocks in the Nasdaq 100.
The ""amazingly"" part of the statement is that almost no one has noticed it or, if they have, they've been saying something like, ""Well it's a fluke.""
Is Apple doing all that well? It does have a big problem in China, where most of its products are made and is a key to the future of the iPhone, which is the company's biggest revenue generator. The worry, for many is that the U.S. trade dispute will delay the introduction of ultra-fast 5-G iPhones.
Still, Apple is generating mounds of cash that will shelter the company if a full-scale trade war erupts. Its iTunes business is growing nicely and it has a rapidly growing subscriptions business. It sells subs for its own products and for other companies.
The top Dow stock this year is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), followed by Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), both of which hit all-time highs on Friday as the Dow moved modestly higher. Microsoft and Cisco are the third- and fourth-best Dow stocks this month.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the top Nasdaq 100 stock because CEO Elon Musk has been able to convince investors better times are ahead.
2. Speaking of Tesla...
On Monday, the Tesla CEO tweeted that he had deleted his Twitter account, but soon resumed sharing bumblebee memes and retweeting Tesla news.
It seems Musk is still addicted to social media. And his tweet about deleting his Twitter account? Gone. Still, investors seem hopeful that Tesla’s controversial CEO might just start acting the part. Musk’s Twitter trolling has caused a lot of stress for investors and regulators alike.
He has had a number of erratic tweets over the years, including telling his followers in August 2018 he was thinking about taking the company private for $420 a share (possibly a reference to marijuana culture). That tweet cost Musk his chairmanship of Tesla and a $40 million fine to the SEC.
Musk’s latest stunt to delete his Twitter account may have given some investors hope that he is ready to grow up, but it’s come at a time when the company is under a lot of financial pressure.
In May Musk told employees he would personally review all of the company’s expenses after its losses in the first quarter were worse than expected.



3. What’s the Business?
Business conditions have been a red flag for the economy this week.
The New York State Empire Manufacturing Index dove into negative territory this week. Even though it’s a region that doesn’t have much manufacturing comparatively, it still shook the bond market when it hit the red.
Later, the Philly Fed index almost went to 0, registering 0.3 for June.
But some investors may not have seen the Morgan Stanley Business Conditions Index (MSBCI), which dropped a huge 32 points in June.
That’s “the largest one-month decline on record, to a level of 13, a low since Dec. 2008. Fundamental indicators pointed to a broad softening of activity,” Morgan Stanley said.
The MSBCI composite index fell 12 points, the largest one month decline since October 2008.
“Analysts highlighted a range of factors behind their responses this month,” Morgan Stanley said “Interesting color came from the consumer sector, where analysts flagged weak 1Q earnings results and lowered expectations for full year 2019 sales and earnings”",0.3731

https://www.investing.com/news/assorted/worldcoin-rebounds-after-altmans-microsoft-role-confirmed-ai-tokens-gain-3238863,"Nov 20, 2023","The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a notable rebound in the value of Worldcoin (WLD), following the confirmation of Sam Altman's new role at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and rumors of his potential new AI venture. After a sharp decline to $2.04 on Sunday in the wake of Altman's departure from OpenAI, WLD surged to $2.71 before stabilizing at $2.51 on Binance today. 
The initial drop came as investors reacted to Altman's ouster, but sentiment shifted with news of his continued influence in the tech industry. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, has confirmed Altman's involvement with the tech giant, sparking investor optimism. Worldcoin was launched in July 2023 by Tools for Humanity as a digital identity platform that rewards users with WLD for retina scans. This innovative approach to establishing digital identity has been a key factor in the currency's adoption and recent price volatility.
In a broader reflection of market interest in AI-driven cryptocurrencies, other AI tokens such as FET, AGIX, and GRT also recorded daily gains. This trend underscores the growing enthusiasm for blockchain projects that integrate artificial intelligence technologies. Investors are closely monitoring the AI cryptocurrency sector as developments unfold, particularly with Altman's potential new AI venture on the horizon.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusiveopenai-investors-considering-suing-the-board-after-ceos-abrupt-firing--sources-3239550,"Nov 20, 2023","By Anna Tong, Krystal Hu and Jody Godoy (Reuters) -Some investors in OpenAI, makers of ChatGPT, are exploring legal recourse against the company's board, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, after the directors ousted CEO Sam Altman and sparked a potential mass exodus of employees. Sources said investors are working with legal advisers to study their options. It was not immediately clear if these investors will sue OpenAI. Investors worry that they could lose hundreds of millions of dollars they invested in OpenAI, a crown jewel in some of their portfolios, with the potential collapse of the hottest startup in the rapidly growing generative AI sector. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) owns 49% of the for-profit operating company, according to sources familiar with the matter. Other investors and employees control 49%, with 2% owned by OpenAI's nonprofit parent, according to Semafor. OpenAI's board fired Altman on Friday after a ""breakdown of communications,"" according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. By Monday, most of OpenAI's more than 700 employees threatened to resign unless the company replaced the board. Venture capital investors usually hold board seats or voting power in their portfolio companies but OpenAI is controlled by its nonprofit parent company OpenAI Nonprofit, which according to OpenAI's website was created to benefit ""humanity, not OpenAI investors."" As a result, employees have more leverage in pressuring the board than the venture capitalists who helped fund the company, said Minor Myers, a law professor at the University of Connecticut. ""There is nobody exactly who is in the seat of an injured investor,"" he said. That is a feature, not a bug of OpenAI's structure, which started out as a nonprofit but added a for-profit subsidiary in 2019 to raise capital. Keeping control of operations let the nonprofit preserve its ""core mission, governance, and oversight,"" according to the company's website. Nonprofit boards have legal obligations to the organizations they oversee. But those obligations, such as the duty to exercise care and avoid self-dealing, leave a lot of leeway for leadership decisions, experts said. Those obligations can be further narrowed in a corporate structure such as OpenAI, which used a limited liability company as its operating arm, potentially further insulating the nonprofit's directors from investors, said Paul Weitzel, a law professor at the University of Nebraska. 
Even if investors found a way to sue, Weitzel said they would have a ""weak case."" Companies have broad latitude under the law to make business decisions, even ones that backfire. ""You can fire visionary founders,"" Weitzel said. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) famously fired Steve Jobs in the 1980s, before bringing him back around a decade later.",-0.945

The tech giant's shares took a hit on Friday when news of Altman’s exit led to a stock decline of over 2 percent, impacting the company's market valuation near the $3 trillion mark. This was notably influenced by Microsoft's substantial $13 billion investment in the artificial intelligence firm.
Over the weekend, Microsoft took action to address the situation at OpenAI's board level. By Sunday, CEO Satya Nadella had announced a significant shift in strategy, revealing that Microsoft would incorporate both Altman and Greg Brockman into leadership roles within a newly established advanced research lab. This move signals Microsoft’s continued dedication to innovation in the AI space.
The appointments have been well-received by market analysts, as evidenced by Microsoft’s stock rebounding in today's premarket trading. 
In the wake of these changes, Emmett Shear has taken on the role of interim CEO at OpenAI following Mira Murati’s brief tenure after Altman was ousted. The quick succession of leadership adjustments at OpenAI contrasts with Microsoft’s swift actions to stabilize and steer its AI ambitions through internal restructuring and talent integration.

The company, which gained recognition for its ChatGPT technology under Altman's tenure, is now navigating through a tumultuous period that has seen calls for board resignations and intense negotiations over its future governance.
Today, the OpenAI board, which includes Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever and external members such as Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner of Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology, has agreed in principle to step down amidst the fallout from Altman's departure. The decision comes as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella plays a pivotal role in discussions about the organization's direction, reflecting Microsoft's substantial $13 billion investment in OpenAI.
The board is currently vetting potential new directors, with Bret Taylor being considered for a seat, and a Microsoft executive might also join the reformed board. This move indicates an ongoing partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI, despite the internal turmoil.
Altman's firing was announced to him by Ilya Sutskever on Friday via a video call. Greg Brockman, who resigned his chairman position but remains president after publicly criticizing the board’s decision on social media, was not present during this call. Mira Murati has taken on the role of interim CEO in the wake of these changes.
The shakeup at OpenAI began following an internal investigation that questioned Altman's transparency with the board. His leadership saw the transition of OpenAI from a nonprofit entity to a profit-driven model and an FTC inquiry into potential legal violations concerning data practices. Prior to his termination, Altman had been actively representing ChatGPT at events like the APEC summit.
Moreover, OpenAI recently paused new subscriptions for ChatGPT’s premium version due to capacity limits being exceeded. This decision underscores the challenges faced by the company as it scales its technologies.
As negotiations over leadership and governance continue to unfold at OpenAI headquarters, all eyes are on how these changes will shape the future of one of the most prominent players in artificial intelligence research.

-Sam Altman has been reinstated as CEO of OpenAI.
-The decision comes after intense pressure from investors, employees, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
-Altman was ousted by the company's board of directors last week.
-A new board of directors will be formed, including Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo.
In a narrative worthy of a Silicon Valley thriller, Sam Altman has reclaimed his position as CEO of OpenAI, barely a week after his startling dismissal—a coup that underscores the volatile nature of tech startups and the intricate dance between innovation and corporate governance.
Altman's ousting became a rallying cry that united OpenAI employees, investors, and tech behemoth Microsoft (MSFT), culminating in a dramatic reversal that reinstates Altman at the helm. This boardroom skirmish was not just about leadership—it was a stark depiction of the high stakes in the AI industry, where the quest for cutting-edge technology can clash with the principles of ethical governance.
Crafting a New Vision: OpenAI's Board Reworked
The restoration of Altman heralds the formation of a new, potentially formidable board. Bret Taylor, known for his strategic agility as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)'s former co-CEO, takes the chair, while the inclusion of Larry Summers and Adam D’Angelo infuses a blend of economic acumen and tech expertise. Their task? To steer OpenAI through uncharted territories as it seeks to fulfill its colossal promise without compromising its foundational ethos.
Microsoft's Gambit: Ensuring Altman's Leadership
Microsoft's pivotal role in Altman's return speaks volumes about the strategic interdependence between the two companies. By throwing its considerable influence behind Altman, Microsoft has made a calculated move to safeguard its interests in OpenAI's groundbreaking AI endeavors. This alliance is a testament to Microsoft's foresight in recognizing that Altman's vision aligns with its own aspirations for the AI landscape.
Looking Ahead: OpenAI at a Crossroads
While Altman's reinstatement might be a cause for celebration, it leaves the tech community pondering the lessons learned from this high-profile power struggle. OpenAI, a paragon of AI innovation, now faces the task of reconciling its ambitious technological pursuits with the imperative of prudent, transparent governance.
As the dust settles on this corporate saga, the eyes of the world remain fixed on OpenAI, a company at the crossroads of a technological revolution. The decisions made in the coming days will not only shape the future of OpenAI but could also set precedents for the broader realm of AI development and management.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-thursday-1981520,"Sep 19, 2019","Investing.com -- Central banks around the world make different responses to the Federal Reserve's rate cut, U.S. stocks are set for a lower opening, and some fresh saber-rattling pushes oil prices back up. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 19th September.
1. Manic monetary Thursday
The global monetary policy easing cycle continued overnight as Indonesia and Hong Kong both cut official interest rates, although the more important Bank of Japan left its key rate unchanged and hinted it may ease at its next meeting in October.
In Europe, the Swiss franc strengthened against both the dollar and the euro after the Swiss National Bank left its key rate unchanged but tweaked the way it will calculate the penalty rate on excess bank reserves going forward, a measure it said would reduce the side-effects of negative interest rates on banks. The Norwegian central bank pulled off what it said it is likely to be its last interest rate hike for the foreseeable future.
The Bank of England and South African Reserve Bank are still to announce their monetary policy decisions.
The decisions came as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development cut its forecast for global growth this year to 2.9%, the lowest in a decade.
2. Stocks set to open lower
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, reversing a late rally at the end of Wednesday’s trading that left markets little changed on the day after the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions and press conference.
By 6 AM ET, Dow Futures were down 51 points or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was also down 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 Futures contract was down 0.3%.
Chairman Jerome Powell indicated at his press conference that the Fed didn’t expect any significant weakening in the U.S. economy in the near term. That thesis will be tested at 8:30 AM ET, when the Philadelphia Fed releases its regular business survey. There will also be the weekly initial jobless claims at the same time. 
3. Fed to soothe money market again
The Federal Reserve is set to hold an overnight repo to ease conditions in the U.S. money market for a third day running.
As it did on Wednesday, the Fed will offer a maximum of $75 billion to banks in overnight funds. Banks had asked for $80 billion at Wednesday’s auction, meaning that there was another scramble at the margin for overnight funds on the open market, which drove the Fed funds rate up to over 2.30%, above the Fed’s old target range of 2%-2.25%.
There’s still no consensus as to the long-term significance of this liquidity squeeze. If, as many argue, the causes are largely technical and short-term, overnight rates should logically return to their targeted level within days. If they don’t, then the Fed may come under pressure to start buying assets again.
4. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) bumps up dividend, buybacks
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares are set to hog the spotlight after the company raised its dividend and expanded the volume of its stock buyback program after the closing bell on Wednesday.
The board raised its quarterly dividend by 11% to 51c, although that still leaves an implicit annual dividend yield of only 1.5%, below the 1.9% average for the S&P 500.
Additionally, the company increased its open-ended stock buyback program by another $40 billion, or just under 4% of its market capitalization.
5. Oil rises again on the tweets of war, Iraq report
Oil prices rose again as tweets by Iran’s foreign minister revived fears of military conflict in the Gulf, only hours after Saudi Arabia and the U.S. had appeared to play down the near-term risk of war.
Iran's Javad Zarif told CNN that the Iranian response to any military strike on it by either the U.S. or Saudi Arabia would be ""all-out war.""
Iran's Javad Zarif told CNN that the Iranian response to any military strike on it by either the U.S. or Saudi Arabia would be ""all-out war.""
The market was also unnerved by reports that Saudi Arabia had asked to buy millions of barrels of crude from Iraq in order to ensure the kingdom meets its commitments to its own customers. That was seen as undermining Saudi officials’ claims that they will rapidly restore output to the level it was at before the attacks on key energy installations at the weekend.
By 6 AM, WTI crude futures were up 1.7% at $59.02 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 2.3% at $65.11 a barrel.",-0.9825
https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/asian-stocks-fall-following-losses-on-wall-street-1935563,"Jul 25, 2019","Investing.com - Asian stocks traded lower in morning trade on Friday following losses on Wall Street overnight.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both slipped 0.2% by 10:36 PM ET (02:36 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.5% after the city reported that it saw its biggest annual drop in exports in almost three and a half years in June.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was also down 0.5%. Softbank Group Corp. (T:9984) received some focus after the company announced a second Vision Fund aimed at investing in technology firms.
SoftBank said it plans to invest $38 billion in the fund, and has secured memorandum of understanding for about a total of $108 billion from companies including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Overnight, U.S. stocks closed lower as concerns rose that the Federal Reserve might be less aggressive than expected on monetary policy next week.
In a speech following the European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate and monetary policy decisions, President Mario Draghi sounded more upbeat on the economy than investors expected, and said the risk of a recession in the region was low.
Some traders interpreted his message as the central bank would not be as aggressive in its easing measures and that the U.S. Federal Reserve could follow suit when it meets next week.
On the data front, investors will likely focus on the second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product data due Friday.
Economists, on average, expect the economy slowed to a pace of 1.8% in the second quarter from the 3.1% rate seen in the previous quarter.
But some analysts appear more optimistic on the pace of economic growth.
""We forecast GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% in 2Q19, led by strong contributions from consumer spending and government expenditures. In part, historical data that is about to be revised contribute to this forecast,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.",0.7982

 Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) Inc. hit the tape in its first day of trading at $24 per share, more than 40% from its $17 per share initial public offering (IPO) price and traded at $25.44 by 13:21 EST, up 49.7%.
Meanwhile, U.S. equities remained under pressure, after upbeat U.S. jobless claims data failed to stem the flow to the downside, as investors seemed to be reluctant to initiate large positions, after all three major indexes posted their best session of the year in the previous session.
Initial jobless claims fell by 19,000 to 223,000 for the week ended February 25, the Labor department said on Thursday. Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 1,000 to 243,000 last week.
Financials, mostly banks, traded in negative territory despite increased expectations of a March rate hike, after several Federal Reserve officials supported the view that the U.S. central bank should raise interest rates sooner rather than later.
Most recently, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said Wednesday evening the Fed could raise rates ""soon,"" while Fed Governor Jerome Powell said Thursday that “the case for a rate increase for March has come together”.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, nearly 80% of traders expect a rate hike in March, compared to just over 60 percent on Wednesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained above 21,000 but traded down 60 points at 21,055.04 with  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  American Express  Company (NYSE:AXP) the main laggards.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/uk-competition-watchdog-to-focus-on-growth-and-innovation-streamline-processes-3242588,"Nov 24, 2023","LONDON - The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is set to receive expanded authority under the Digital Markets Act, emphasizing economic growth and innovation. This move comes after the CMA faced criticism for its initial resistance to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), which was eventually approved in October. Despite the controversy, which Microsoft President Brad Smith referred to as Britain's ""darkest day"" in tech, the CMA has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining market competitiveness and fairness.
The UK government has issued a policy paper instructing the CMA to reduce regulatory burdens on businesses and focus on sectors that are critical for economic growth. This guidance follows scrutiny over the handling of the Microsoft-Activision deal, particularly concerns related to the cloud gaming market. As part of its annual plan, the CMA aims to generate economic benefits at least ten times greater than its operational costs.
On Thursday, Kevin Hollinrake, a UK official, highlighted objectives that include support for investment and measures to alleviate the cost of living through advancements in the digital economy. In response to these directives, Sarah Cardell of the CMA stated on Friday that while the agency is refining its merger investigation process for greater efficiency, it will not waver in protecting UK consumers and businesses from deals that could harm them.
The CMA's renewed focus on fostering growth and innovation while safeguarding consumer interests reflects its evolving role post-Brexit. With increased responsibilities, the agency is adapting its approach to ensure that it continues to serve as a guardian against monopolistic practices without stifling economic development.

But which of these stocks is a better buy now?

(CRM), which is also a well-known player in the industry, develops enterprise cloud computing solutions with a focus on customer relationship management worldwide.
Over the past year, the adoption of a remote work structure has intensified the role of technology in organizations. Organizations are seeking new ways to improve their operations to ensure higher productivity. Changing market dynamics have led to an accelerated demand for cloud-based solutions, which has aided the software as a service (SaaS) market. The global SaaS market is expected to reach $436.9 billion in 2025 growing at a 12.5% CAGR. As major players in the industry, we think both MSFT and CRM should continue to benefit substantially from the industry tailwinds.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/microsoft-stock-shows-promise-despite-valuation-concerns-2616387,"Sep 14, 2021","Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is perhaps the world's leading tech giant when it comes to complete software solutions.
With a flawless execution strategy, this company has derived superb long-term performance for shareholders. This performance has actually improved during the pandemic, providing another boost to this hyper-growth stock.
The company's share price has hit what many believe to be peak prices. Yet, many investors continue to pile into MSFT stock, despite its ballooning valuation. (See Microsoft stock charts on TipRanks)
This is now a company that's worth more than $2.2 trillion, an absolutely incredible sum of money, and the second-highest valuation in stock market history.
Many would argue that Microsoft's valuation is warranted. The company's underlying suite of products and services is impressive. Investors looking for growth have a reliable long-term champion in this regard with Microsoft.
Others remain uneasy. Perhaps the recent market-driven rally has been too much for value investors. Over the past week, we saw more selling than we have in quite some time. Accordingly, maybe now is the time to take some profits off the table.
I'm still bullish on the stock, despite the potential for volatility on the horizon.
MSFT Stock Comes with Ambitious Growth Narrative
MSFT investors are buying into a company with strong business fundamentals, as well as a strong growth outlook for the long-term. In fact, there are a number of investors who think Microsoft's growth narrative is one of the best in the market right now.
Now, Microsoft's time in the market may be a reason investors overlook this growth champion. After all, a company that's been around since the previous tech bubble can't have any more innovative lead left in its pencil, right?
Not so fast. Microsoft's increasing focus on its cloud technology and other growth segments is impressive. This is a company with a world-class management team that has done well to spur growth in recent years. Expectations are that Microsoft could grow its revenue by nearly 12% for some time. That's impressive, especially for a company of Microsoft's size.
Additionally, Wall Street estimates imply earnings per share will double to nearly $16 in the coming five years. Microsoft does have an impressive track record in this regard, thanks to its generous buyback program, and growth-oriented business model.
Of course, the past two quarters have been impressive for MSFT stock due to Microsoft's strong top- and bottom-line results. The company posted bottom-line gains of 44% year-over-year this past quarter, with revenue growing by 19%. As demand continues to increase for Microsoft's core product suite, and the work-from-home trend comes into play once again with the Delta variant of COVID-19, anything's possible for this growth stock.
In particular, 39% growth in the company's cloud bookings is notable. If Microsoft can grow this high-margin business rapidly, there's no doubt this valuation makes sense right now.
Or does it?
The Valuations Are Not Wrong
Despite the above positive catalysts, some investors are simply too bearish to go near any high-growth stock today. That sentiment sure seems to make sense, given the elevated valuation of the overall market right now.
However, there are reasons for these higher valuations right now. Interest rates remain near historic lows, and are likely to for some time. Investors seeking a reasonable return on their capital have few places to put it.
Given the momentum in growth stocks, it's hard to ignore the wealth-creating impacts of long-term gems like Microsoft.
What Are Analysts Saying about MSFT Stock?
As per TipRanks' analyst rating consensus, MSFT stock is a Strong Buy. Out of 22 analyst ratings, there are 22 Buy recommendations.
The average MSFT price target is $332.33. MSFT’s price target lies between a low of $275 per share, and a high of $411 per share.
Bottom Line
Microsoft is in a position to benefit from strong secular trends for a long time.
This company's focus on innovation, and technological superiority in its core segments, are likely to drive continued long-term growth.
Accordingly, investors looking for a mega-cap champion have a great option in MSFT stock.

This follows a previous wave of job cuts in May that resulted in 716 layoffs. The total number of layoffs now stands at 1,384, representing about 3% of the company's global workforce.
The decision comes as part of a broader restructuring effort aimed at streamlining decision-making and adapting organizational structures. LinkedIn, which boasts a user base of around 950 million, reported a 5% growth rate last quarter. The company remains committed to delivering value to its members and investing in strategic growth areas, such as AI-powered collaborative articles, identified as the fastest-growing traffic driver.
According to Microsoft's full-fiscal-year earnings report from July 2023, LinkedIn generated $15 billion in revenue. However, the company has been grappling with slowing revenue growth, prompting these organizational changes.
Microsoft, which includes LinkedIn in its portfolio, is expected to release fiscal Q1 reports on October 24. Market analysts anticipate earnings of $2.65 per share on revenues of $54.52B. The Wall Street consensus maintains a Strong Buy rating for MSFT stock and predicts a price target of $396.94 per share, indicating an upside potential of 18.88%.
This news comes amid reports of over 242,000 tech sector layoffs in 2023 by Layoffs.fyi. The ongoing restructuring at LinkedIn is reflective of broader trends within the tech industry as companies adapt to changing market dynamics and seek efficiency in operations.

As technology stocks and FAANG lead the markets lower in this latest market sell-off, investors may have a chance to pounce on the blue-chip behemoth that only seldom goes on sale.
With plenty of growth drivers and little hair to be found in the company's solid fundamentals, I am bullish on Microsoft stock, even more so as shares approach correction territory. (See Microsoft stock charts on TipRanks)
The company's growth isn't about to slow down anytime soon, even if the road ahead is more challenging, with higher rates in the forecast and the easing of COVID-19 tailwinds.
Microsoft's Growth Engine
Microsoft has so many growth levers that it can pull. Whether we're talking about its dominant position in the Xbox gaming business, or Azure, it's clear that there are few dents to be had in Microsoft's armor.
Despite being an old company, Microsoft has found ways to adapt to maintain its stellar growth rate.
Windows and Microsoft Office subscriptions continue being a major cash cow for Microsoft. That said, both ageless wonders are no longer the same needle movers they once were.
Still, momentum in Microsoft's higher-growth businesses is more than capable of making up for any slowed momentum in its widely used software offerings.
Over the past three years, Microsoft's growth has been impressive for a firm its size, with an average annualized revenue growth just north of 15%.
Amid the pandemic, Microsoft has shifted into high gear, posting increased strength across almost every front and making the most of the pandemic-induced bump in enterprise IT spend.
Indeed, it will be tough to derail Microsoft, even as its stock sinks into year-end due to broader market weakness.
Azure Gaining Momentum
The Azure cloud-computing business, in particular, has grown into a force to be reckoned with in recent years. CEO Satya Nadella has done an incredible job of putting Azure on the map, making the name one of the best ways to play the ongoing digital transformation.
In the fiscal fourth quarter, Azure enjoyed an incredible 51% in sales growth, or 45% on a constant-currency basis. Indeed, Azure has the winds to its back in today's increasingly digitized workplace such that higher rates or slowed economic growth is unlikely to take a significant stride out of Azure's step.
With a nearly 19% share of the global cloud infrastructure service market, Azure still has room to run despite more than doubling its share in just a few years.
Can Microsoft double its market share again over the next three years? It will be more challenging, but if it can pull it off, the rewards for shareholders could be huge, as it looks to pressure its peers in the public cloud.
Wall Street's Take
According to TipRanks' analyst rating consensus, MSFT stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 21 analyst ratings, there are 21 unanimous Buy recommendations.
The average Microsoft price target is $336.19. Analyst price targets range from a low of $275 per share, to a high of $411 per share.
Bottom Line
A correction in MSFT stock may very well be a gift. Microsoft is firing on all cylinders, doubling down on top growth drivers like Azure.
The froth has been cut off the top of MSFT stock, making it one of the more intriguing FAANG stocks to consider.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/prominent-us-litigator-david-boies-to-step-down-as-law-firm-leader-3237966,"Nov 17, 2023","By David Thomas (Reuters) - David Boies, who became one of America's most prominent lawyers in cases involving Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the 2000 U.S. presidential election and the fight to legalize same-sex marriage, is stepping down next year as leader of the law firm he co-founded. The firm's partnership has been in tumult in recent years in part because of Boies' representation of controversial clients like disgraced Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein.  Boies' tenure as chairman of Boies Schiller Flexner ends December 2024, a firm spokesperson said on Friday. A new chairman-will be selected next month, the spokesperson said. The firm said the 82-year-old Boies is not retiring and will remain a partner. Boies was not immediately available to comment.  Boies Schiller has lost nearly half of its lawyers over the last three years. It now lists 180 lawyers in 13 offices. The firm has altered its leadership structure in the same period, electing multiple co-managing partners as it looked ahead to a future without its founder.  One of them, Nicholas Gravante, departed for rival law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in 2020. Another who briefly held the role, Natasha Harrison, left Boies Schiller last year to found her own firm. Boies Schiller is now managed by a trio of managing partners, who praised Boies' leadership in a statement on Friday. ""We greatly appreciate the faith David and the rest of the firm has placed in us,"" partners Matthew Schwartz, Sigrid McCawley and Alan Vickery said in a statement.  In 1997, the same year he started his firm, Boies was hired by the U.S. government for its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft, boosting the firm's reputation as a litigation powerhouse.  
He unsuccessfully represented Democrat Al Gore in his U.S. Supreme Court fight with George W. Bush over the 2000 election and later helped overturn California's ban on gay marriage. In recent years, he was criticized for representing Weinstein, as well as biotechnology company Theranos, which falsely claimed to pioneer blood tests needing minute amounts of blood, and where Boies sat on the board.",0.2143

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-thursday-1949118,"Aug 08, 2019","Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, August 8:
1. China’s exports show encouraging signs
China’s exports registered a surprise return to growth in July, while imports fell less than expected.
The 3.3% increase in exports was the biggest since March, although economists warned it could be short-lived if Washington follows through with additional tariffs on Chinese goods in September.
Imports showed weakness with a 5.6% slide that nevertheless was less than consensus had feared.
Adding to better-than-expected trade data out of China, Beijing fixed the yuan Thursday at a firmer level than forecasts compiled by Bloomberg and Reuters, even though it was beyond 7 per dollar level for the first time since the global financial crisis.
2. Markets return to calm after wild ride
An impressive recovery on Wall Street after brief panic a day earlier boosted global stocks Thursday.
Positive Chinese trade data seemed to calm nerves further with investors selling off safe-haven assets - such as U.S. Treasuries, gold and the yen - and returning to equities.
Asian shares ended the session higher while European stocks advanced near midday trade in the region.
U.S. futures pointed to a higher open ahead of a smattering of earnings reports and the publication of weekly jobless claims.
3. Uber set to report after positive numbers from  Lyft  
 Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) set the bar high on quarterly earnings for Uber (NYSE:UBER) as the latter prepares to report after the market close.
Lyft’s quarterly revenue beat consensus and its net loss narrowed substantially as its price war with Uber eased, allowing it to lifted its full-year guidance.
Lyft shares surged 6% in premarket while Uber jumped nearly 5%.
Amid other companies on the earnings calendar, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB) will release quarterly numbers ahead of the open while Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) and News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) will join Uber after the close.
4. Netflix grabs Game of Thrones creators; Microsoft and Samsung hook up
Outside of earnings in company news, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) beat out Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) and Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN) in a bidding war to score a multi-year deal with “Game of Thrones” creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss, according to media reports.
The Hollywood Reporter said the deal was valued at $200 million.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella appeared as a surprise guest at Samsung’s (KS:005930) launch of its Galaxy Note 10, announcing new features that let Android mobile apps sync with Windows PCs.
5. Oil rebounds from 7-month lows on Saudi move to support prices
Oil bounced back from its lowest in nearly seven months as Saudi Arabia reportedly contacted other producers to discuss action on halting a plunge in prices.
With oil prices down more than 10% this month on fears the U.S.-China trade conflict will dampen global demand, Bloomberg citied an unnamed Saudi official as saying the de facto OPEC leader will not tolerate continued price weakness and is considering all options.

"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-stocks-mixed,-as-dow-extends-longest-winning-streak-in-three-years-415291","Jul 19, 2016","Investing.com -- U.S. stocks were mixed on Tuesday, remaining near-record territory, as considerable gains in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) were offset by sharp declines in Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares after the global streaming film provider saw user growth fall precipitously over its previous quarter.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 25.96 or 0.14% to close at an all-time high of 18,559.01, recording its eighth consecutive winning session. At session-highs, the Dow reached an all-time intraday high of 18,562.19, hitting a record intra-session peak for the seventh straight session. Since falling approximately 850 points in the two sessions following last month's Brexit decision, the Dow has rallied more than 8.25%. The eight-session winning streak is the Dow's longest in more than three years. The NASDAQ Composite index fell 19.41 or 0.38% to 5,036.37, while the S&P Composite index lost 3.11 or 0.14% to 2,163.78, as Netflix weighed on both indices.
On the S&P 500, nine of 10 sectors closed in the red as stocks in the Basic Materials, Energy and the Telecom industries lagged. Stocks in the Financials sector led after closing as the only industry in positive territory for the day.
The top performer on the Dow was McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), which added 2.74 or 2.21% to 126.54. McDonald's shares popped on Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal reported that the fast food giant's unit in Japan will sponsor the Pokemon Go reality game when it makes its debut on Wednesday. Within three days of its launch in the U.S., Pokemon Go attracted more than 20 million users, becoming the most popular mobile game on American soil. The worst performer was MSFT, which fell 0.96 or 1.78% ahead of its release of quarterly earnings in after-hours trading. When Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) disclosed its first quarter results earlier this years, shares plunged 7% over the next 24 hours following worse than expected earnings.
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was  Jd.Com Inc Adr  (NASDAQ:JD), which added 0.28 or 1.26% to 22.42. Shares in the Chinese e-commerce site are up roughly 1% since Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) purchased a 5% stake in the company a month ago. Despite the slight gains, JD.com is still down 27% over the last three months. The worst performer was Netflix, which tumbled 12.97 or 13.13% to 85.84. It came amid a major slowdown in subscriber growth last quarter, as users expressed widespread concerns with the company's planned price increases of $2 a month. As a result, new Netflix subscribers rose by 1.7 million for the three-month period, falling sharply below analysts' expectations for gains of 2.5 million.
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 1,718-1,247 margin.",0.9729
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/economic-calendar--top-5-things-to-watch-this-week-1161437,"Jan 28, 2018","Investing.com - Global financial markets will focus on this week's Federal Reserve policy meeting, which will be the last under the leadership of Janet Yellen before she hands the chairmanship over to Jerome Powell.
There are also some major data releases in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to February from January, with Friday's monthly employment data in the spotlight.
Meanwhile, in Europe, investors will await monthly inflation data to assess how fast the European Central Bank will start unwinding its asset purchase program.
In the UK, traders will focus on a pair of reports on activity in the manufacturing and construction sectors for further hints on the health of the economy and the likelihood of the Bank of England raising interest rates this year.
Elsewhere, market participants will be looking ahead to monthly data on China's manufacturing sector amid recent signs that momentum in the world's second largest economy remains strong.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. Federal Reserve Rate Decision
The Federal Reserve is not expected to take action on interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting at 2:00PM ET (1900GMT) on Wednesday, keeping it in a range between 1.25%-1.50%.
The central bank will release its post-meeting statement as investors look for any change in language which could point more clearly to a rate hike in the months ahead.
This week's meeting will be the last under the leadership of Janet Yellen, before she is replaced by Fed Governor Jerome Powell.
The majority of economists believe that the Fed will hike rates in March, followed by another hike in June, with a third move higher arriving in December.
2. U.S. Employment Report
The U.S. Labor Department will release its January nonfarm payrolls report at 8:30AM ET (1330GMT) on Friday.
The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 180,000, after rising by 148,000 in December. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.1%. Most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings figures, which are expected to rise 0.3% after gaining 0.3% a month earlier.
This week's calendar also features reports on personal income and spending, which includes the personal consumption expenditures inflation data, the Fed's preferred metric for inflation.
Data on consumer confidence, ADP private sector payrolls, pending home sales, ISM manufacturing sector growth, weekly jobless claims, construction spending, auto sales and factory orders will also be on the agenda.
Meanwhile, for the stock market, more than a fifth of the S&P 500 companies release earnings, with reports from tech heavyweights Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) likely to garner most of the attention.
Results from Dow components Boeing (NYSE:BA), AT&T (NYSE:T) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) as well as big oil firms ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) will also be in focus.
On the political front, another headliner this week will be President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday. The theme of Trump's address will be ""building a safe, strong and proud America,"" a senior administration official told reporters on Friday.
According to the White House, the speech will focus on five main policy areas: jobs and the economy, infrastructure, immigration, trade and national security.
3. Euro Zone Flash Inflation
The euro zone will publish flash inflation figures for January at 1000GMT (5:00AM ET) Wednesday.
The consensus forecast is that the report will show consumer prices rose 1.3%, slowing slightly from 1.4% in December, remaining short of the European Central Bank's target of just below 2%. Perhaps more significantly, the core figure, without volatile energy and food prices, is seen inching up to 1.0% from 0.9% a month earlier.
Germany, France, Italy and Spain will produce their own CPI reports throughout the week.
In addition to the inflation data, the euro zone will publish a preliminary report on fourth-quarter economic growth on Tuesday, which if they remain strong could push the European Central Bank another step closer to ending its mass stimulus program.
The region's economy is forecast to expand 0.6% in the June-Sept. period, equivalent to an annualized 2.7%.
The ECB reiterated last week that it will keep its €2.5 trillion stimulus program in place for as long as needed and stated that there are ""very few chances"" that it will change interest rates this year. Despite those remarks, market players remain convinced that easy monetary policy in the region is coming to an end sooner rather than later.
The central bank cut its monthly bond purchases from €60 billion to €30 billion back in October, but extended the program until the end of September 2018, citing muted price pressures.
4. U.K. PMI's
The U.K. will release readings on January manufacturing sector activity at 0930GMT (4:30AM ET) on Thursday, followed by a report on the construction sector on Friday.
The manufacturing PMI is forecast to ease up to 56.5 from 56.3 a month earlier, while construction activity is expected to weaken slightly to 52.0 from 52.2.
Data released last week showed Britain's economy unexpectedly picked up speed in the last three months of 2017, revealing that Brexit was still weighing on the economy, but not as heavily as once feared by investors.
Politics is also likely to be in focus, as market participants keep an ear out for any news regarding the ongoing Brexit negotiations.
The Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in more than ten years in November, but said it sees only gradual rises ahead as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.
5. Chinese Manufacturing PMI
The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing is to release data on January manufacturing sector activity at 0100GMT on Wednesday, amid expectations for a modest downtick to 51.5 from a reading of 51.6 in December.
The Caixin manufacturing index, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, is due at 0145GMT Friday. The survey is expected to dip by 0.2 points to 51.3.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI) is seen as a good indicator of economic conditions and it is even preferred by some analysts to gross domestic product, which might be affected by poor seasonal adjustment and is prone to revisions.
Anything above 50.0 signals expansion, while readings below 50.0 indicate industry contraction.
China's economy grew 6.8% in the fourth-quarter from a year earlier, helped by a rebound in the industrial sector, a resilient property market and strong export growth.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusiveopenai-explores-how-to-get-chatgpt-into-classrooms-3236851,"Nov 16, 2023","By Anna Tong SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - OpenAI, whose generative AI products initially raised fears of widespread cheating on homework, is now exploring how it can get its popular ChatGPT chatbot into classrooms, according to a senior executive. OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap, said at a conference in San Francisco that the company will form a team to explore educational applications of a technology that has threatened to upend industries, stoked new legislation and become a popular learning tool.  “Most teachers are trying to figure out ways to incorporate (ChatGPT) into the curriculum and into the way they teach,” Lightcap said at the INSEAD Americas Conference last week. “We at OpenAI are trying to help them think through the problem and we probably next year will establish a team with the sole intent of doing that.” Lightcap's comments were previously unreported. INSEAD is a global business school. Backed by billions of dollars from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), OpenAI kicked off the generative AI craze last November by releasing its ChatGPT chatbot, which became one of the world's fastest-growing applications. Trained on reams of data, generative AI can create brand-new humanlike content, helping users spin up term papers, complete science homework and even write entire novels. After ChatGPT's launch, regulators scrambled to catch up: the European Union revised its AI Act and the U.S. kicked off AI regulation efforts. The launch - in the middle of the school year - also caught teachers off-guard when they realized it could be used as a cheating and plagiarism tool, which then sparked a backlash and school bans.  “Teachers thought it was the worst thing that had ever happened,” Lightcap said. But within a few months, teachers started seeing how ChatGPT could be beneficial, he said. A new team at OpenAI would be an extension of the work the company has already done to integrate its technology into the classroom. ""“We see AI as an impactful tool that can assist with learning and education, and we’re encouraged by the ways educators have been ideating on how tools like ChatGPT can be useful,"" a spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement. ""We are engaging with educators across the country to inform them of ChatGPT’s capabilities and our ongoing work to improve it. ""This is an important conversation to have so that they are aware of the potential benefits and misuse of AI, and so they understand how they might apply it to their classrooms."" OpenAI has established partnerships with education groups such as Khan Academy to create an AI-powered tutor and with Schmidt Futures to give grants to education groups in underserved communities.  The market is large: global education and training expenditures will reach $10 trillion by 2030, estimates Sydney-based research firm HolonIQ.  There are myriad ways to use ChatGPT in classrooms, said Andrew Mayne, a former OpenAI employee who works with educators through his AI consulting firm Interdimensional. For students, it could be a tutor or it can tailor content for different learning styles. For teachers, it can assist with curriculum writing or be a creative classroom aide, for instance creating introductions in Old English during a class on medieval times. 
“ChatGPT doesn’t judge you,” he said. “Students are afraid to ask questions in class.” Others see a potential quagmire of children’s privacy issues if the chatbot's use is promoted in schools. In many countries, different online privacy laws apply to children. While users must be over 13 to use ChatGPT and parents must give permission if the users are aged 13 to 18, there is no age verification in place in most countries.",0.9838

Shares were trading a shade higher at $2,000.95 in premarket trade on Thursday, putting the company’s market capitalization just shy of $975 billion.
The stock would have to hit $2053 to reach the $1 trillion market cap.
Morgan Stanley boosted its price target to $2,500 from $1,800 on Wednesday. It is the highest target out of the 41 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet.
At a $2,500 stock price, Amazon would have a market valuation of about $1.2 trillion.
""We have increasing confidence that Amazon's rapidly growing, increasingly large, high margin revenue streams (advertising, AWS, subscriptions) will drive higher profitability and continued upward estimate revisions,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak.
Amazon shares are up 65% so far this year vs. the S&P 500's 8% gain. Over the past 12 months, Amazon has gained a whopping 103%, while the S&P 500 has returned 18%.
Earlier this month, Apple was the first company to break through the $1 trillion market cap level, doing so on August 2.
Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are also in the $1 trillion conversation, with market caps in the range of $850 billion.
The likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon, Apple, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google, who make up Wall Street’s so-called 'FAANG' stocks, have propelled stock markets to record highs in 2018, with the Nasdaq reaching the 8,000-point milestone for the first time this week.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1762280,"Jan 29, 2019","Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Apple Results Hit Targets
Apple will likely lend support to stocks at the open tomorrow after it reported profit and revenue just above analysts’ forecasts.
The company also guided its second-quarter revenue in line with consensus estimates.
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 5.4% in postmarket trading.
Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) should also help techs. It gained more than 8% after hours, despite missing on quarterly revenue targets, after it said it sees 2019 revenue growth in the high single digits.
Tomorrow is another earnings-packed day, with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and AT&T (NYSE:T) reporting ahead of trading.
After the bell brings results from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
2. Fed Day; Pending Home Sales Scheduled
The Federal Reserve will announce its decision on interest rates tomorrow, although there’s little suspense.
There is a 99% chance that the FOMC keeps rates steady in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Of more interest will be Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference, with expectations that he will reiterate that the Fed can be patient on monetary policy.
The decision comes at 2 PM ET (19:00 GMT), and the press conference is slated for 2:30 PM ET.
Even though the partial government shutdown has ended, there’s still a knock-on effect with economic data.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis is delaying the releases of advance fourth-quarter GDP and December personal spending.
No new date for the reports has been set yet.
But there will be the latest numbers on pending home sales at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect the National Association of Realtors to report a 1.1% rise in pending home sales for December.
3. Oil Inventories Arrive
The weekly oil inventories numbers continue to have a big impact on the market.
The Energy Information Administration will issue its weekly figures at 10:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT).
In the previous week to Jan. 18, the EIA announced a larger-than-expected build of 4.05 million barrels in gasoline stockpiles to a record high 259.6 million barrels.
Crude inventories rose by 7.97 million barrels while stockpiles of distillates, which produce diesel and other commercial fuels, decreased by 0.62 million barrels.",0.8269
https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/forex--dollar-pushes-higher-but-gains-checked-aussie-weaker-1756028,"Jan 24, 2019","Investing.com - The U.S. dollar pushed higher against a basket of its rivals on Thursday but gains were held in check by concerns over global growth, the U.S. government shutdown and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.
""Trade tensions are the most dominant factor for investor sentiment right now and will drive market flows,"" said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities.
Twidale added that investor risk appetite will only improve once concerns over the partial U.S. government shutdown and trade tensions fade. Trade tensions were evident again Thursday as access to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Bing search engine was blocked in China.
Global growth concerns have also spooked investors. On Monday, the International Monetary Fund cut its 2019 and 2020 global growth forecasts, citing a bigger-than-expected slowdown in China and the euro zone, and said failure to resolve trade tensions could further destabilize a slowing global economy.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.12% to 95.88 by 03:05 AM ET (08:05 AM GMT).
Markets are bearish on the outlook for the dollar this year. Worries over the global economic outlook have forced the U.S. Federal Reserve to take a cautious approach on any further interest rate increases. Traders in interest rate futures are wagering that the Federal Reserve will stand pat on rates in 2019.
The Australian dollar was lower, with AUD/USD losing 0.6% to trade at 0.7097.
The Aussie was pressured lower after National Australia Bank dealt a fresh blow to the country's rapidly-cooling housing market as it joined its peers in hiking mortgage rates, stoking talk of an interest rate cut. Earlier, the Aussie was in positive terrain on the back of solid jobs data.
The yen was a touch lower against the dollar, with USD/JPY inching up 0.09% to 109.68.
The euro was marginally lower, with EUR/USD at 1.1373.
Traders expected the European Central Bank to remain dovish at its policy meeting later in the day and to keep monetary policy accommodative for an extended period of time.
Low inflation as well as weaker-than-expected economic activity in Germany and France, however, may lead ECB President Mario Draghi to point toward a potentially longer lasting slowdown.
""If the central bank lowers its growth or inflation forecasts and Draghi focuses on weaker growth, we could see EUR/USD fall to $1.12 easily,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management.
The pound was lower, with GBP/USD down 0.21% to 1.3038 as uncertainty over Brexit continued.
Since Prime Minister Theresa May's divorce deal with the EU was rejected by lawmakers last week in the biggest defeat in modern British history, lawmakers have been trying to plot a course out of the crisis, yet no option has the majority support of parliament.
Some analysts expect limited upside for sterling. Philip Wee, currency strategist at DBS says that most of the gains in the pound are due to the unwinding of short positions. He sees sterling capped in the range of $1.3170-1.3240.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/top-5-things-that-moved-markets-this-past-week-1539094,"Jul 20, 2018","Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Banks Lead in Earnings; Netflix Plunges
Earnings season was in full flight for the week and the majority hit or beat Wall Street expectations.
The financial sector continued to perform well.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) led the broker-dealer reports and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also topped estimates, although concerns about its succession plan hit the stock later in the day.
And it was a tale of two techs as a momentum stock fell short of what investors wanted and an old stalwart came through.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock tumbled at the start of the week after the company missed expectations on new subscribers, a key metric for the streaming company. Netflix added 5.14 million subscribers in the latest quarter, shy of analysts’ expectations for more than 6.2 million.
But after the bell Thursday, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported second-quarter earnings that beat consensus thanks to cloud services revenue.
2. Fed’s Powell Sees Steady Rate Increases; Trump Not Thrilled
The prospect for the path of U.S. interest rates took an interesting turn at the end of the week. At first things seemed to jibe with market expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise rates once and possibly twice before the year is out.
At his Humphey-Hawkins testimony before the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank should gradually increase interest rates.
But President Donald Trump shook some of the market’s confidence, saying on Thursday he’s “not thrilled” about the Fed hiking rates and going into more specifics on Twitter Friday.






The tweets had little overall impact on the market forecasts for upcoming rate hikes. But they did take the legs from the dollar on Friday. The U.S. Treasury Department has long had a policy of simply stating that a strong dollar is in America’s best interest.
3. Buffett Buyback Bonanza in the Offing?
Big names can still move the market. Warren Buffett showed that when Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) led the financial stocks higher on Wednesday after saying that the Oracle of Omaha (and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger) would have fewer restrictions on stock buybacks.
Buffett and Munger will now be able to buy back shares when they feel those shares are below “intrinsic value.”
Under its previous buyback policy the company only repurchased shares when they were below 1.2x book value.
That led to some speculation that a big buyback could be coming after Berkshire reports earnings Aug. 3. The company hasn’t bought back stock since 2012.
4. Trump Threatens More Tariffs
Trade-war concerns took at back seat through most of the week, but were revived Friday and could weigh more heavily next week, despite another full earnings calendar.
President Trump said in an interview on CNBC that he is ready to impose tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods to the U.S. if China does not back down on its trade policies.
“I’m not doing this for politics, I’m doing this to do the right thing for our country” he said on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box."" “We have been ripped off by China for a long time.”
5. Oil Down for the Week, Again
Crude oil prices posted a second-straight weekly decline and may continue to weigh on energy stocks, as they have of late.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery rose $1.30 to settle at $70.46 a barrel Friday.
Investors continue to weigh up the prospect of a global shortage in supplies, despite Saudi Arabia's pledge to hold off flooding the market with more output.
Crude oil prices were supported Friday by the plunge in the dollar following Trump’s remark about the greenback and other currencies.",0.9834

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chipotles-spectacular-recovery-discovers-resistance-1777577,"Feb 12, 2019","Investing.com - Not many stocks have had the run Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has had since the beginning of the year and since it reported better-than-expected results on Feb. 7.
The stock is up nearly 38% and has more than doubled since bottoming last year.
The question now is if it has moved too high? The shares hit a 52-week high of $612.60 soon after Tuesday's open, but then fell back and were trading down 1.7% late afternoon.
Clearly, some profit-taking set in.
Chipotle has struggled in recent years from growing way too fast and then getting into trouble with food-safety problems. The company has scaled back new store openings and concentrated on getting the basic operations back into shape.
The exercise was painful. The shares were off as much as 65% from their top in 2015 until bottoming last year.
Chipotle's run-up is one of a few stocks that have hit new highs, and they're not tech stocks.
Along with Chipotle, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has also hit new highs, along with such, well, boring stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) and AutoZone (NYSE:AZO). A glamour stock bucking the trend has been Boeing (NYSE:BA).
At some point, maybe soon, these stocks will fade, while some of the stars like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) re-assert themselves. The former two are still off more than 20% from their highs reached last summer. Microsoft is off 8% or so from its 52-week high.
But Chipotle's reaching its 52-week high – and dropping back -- may be a lesson for those hoping the market can blast through the highs of 2018.",0.9253

Over the weekend, both the U.S. and Chinese governments had indicated that technical preparations for their so-called 'phase-1' deal had made good progress, with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce saying in a statement that the groundwork was ""basically completed"".
Risk appetite received a further boost on Monday morning when the European Union confirmed that it had offered the U.K. a three-month extension to the deadline for Brexit, definitively removing the risk of a disorderly rupture on Oct. 31.
In corporate news, Microsoft rose 3.2% to a new all-time high after it won a multi-billion dollar Cloud computing order from the Pentagon, beating out its biggest rival in the space, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). AT&T (NYSE:T) rose 3.8% after saying it was on track to meet its profit and deleveraging targets, and issuing a three-year action plan for raising shareholder value that was approved by activist investor Elliott Management.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/economic-calendar--top-5-things-to-watch-this-week-545348,"Oct 22, 2017","Investing.com - Global financial markets will focus on this week's European Central Bank meeting for further details on how the central bank plans to taper its massive economic stimulus program.
Meanwhile, investors will keep an eye on a preliminary reading of third-quarter U.S. growth to further assess what the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria was on economic activity and how it could affect the Federal Reserve's view on monetary policy.
In the U.K., market players will focus on the first estimate of U.K. third-quarter GDP for further hints on the health of the economy and the likelihood of the Bank of England raising interest rates this year.
Elsewhere, Japanese inflation data will be in focus as investors assess the need for further stimulus in the world's third's largest economy.
A monetary policy announcement from the Bank of Canada will also be on the agenda.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. European Central Bank Policy Meeting
The European Central Bank's latest interest rate decision is due at 1145GMT (7:45AM ET) on Thursday, with no major policy changes expected.
Most of the focus will be on President Mario Draghi's press conference 45 minutes after the announcement, as investors look for more clues on when and how the ECB could start unwinding its monthly quantitative easing program.
Market experts believe the ECB will announce that it will start trimming its monthly asset purchases to €40 billion from the current €60 billion beginning in January. They were mostly split on whether the program would last six or nine more months after that.
Sources close to the ECB's pre-meeting discussions say the a nine-month extension seems likely with debate over monthly volumes between €25-and-€40 billion a month.
But the real issue will be whether to keep the asset buys open ended, making another extension possible, or signal an eventual end of bond purchases, as demanded by hawks, including powerhouse Germany.
Besides the ECB, market players will eye flash survey data on October euro zone business activity due on Tuesday to gauge the strength of the region's economy. There is also a survey on German business morale from the Ifo institute scheduled for Wednesday.
2. U.S. Advanced 3rd quarter GDP
The U.S. is to release preliminary figures on third-quarter economic growth at 8:30AM ET (1230GMT) Friday.
The report is expected to show growth slowing to an annual rate of 2.6% from 3.1%, with a decline in retail sales, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
Besides the GDP report, this week's calendar also features data on durable goods orders, new home sales and weekly jobless claims.
Interest rate futures are pricing in around a 90% chance of a December Fed rate hike according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. The U.S. central bank has already raised rates twice this year.
Investors are also likely to continue to monitor the latest headlines coming out of Washington in regard to the Trump Administration's tax reform package.
Meanwhile, for the stock market, investors will digest a heavy week of earnings, with more than a third of the S&P 500 companies and 13 Dow stocks set to post results.
FANG names - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) – will garner most of the attention, as will Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F).
3. UK Preliminary Q3 GDP
The Office for National Statistics is to produce preliminary data on U.K. economic growth for the third quarter at 0830GMT (4:30AM ET) on Wednesday.
The report is forecast to reveal the economy grew 0.3% in the three months ended September 30, after expanding at the same rate in the previous three-month period.
On an annualized rate, the British economy is expected to grow 1.4% in the third quarter, slowing from growth of 1.5% in the preceding quarter.
Recent data has painted a subdued picture of the economy just as the BoE prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. The UK central bank said in September that it was likely to raise borrowing costs in the months ahead if the economy and price pressures kept growing.
Politics is likely to be at the back of investors' minds, as they keep an ear out for any news regarding the Brexit negotiations.
4. Japan Inflation Data
Japan's Statistics Bureau will publish October inflation figures at 2330GMT Thursday (7:30PM ET). Market analysts expect the headline figure to remain positive, rising 0.8% year-on-year, which would be the ninth straight month of annual increases.
But the modest year-on-year increase will be well off the Bank of Japan's target and keep the central bank under pressure to maintain its massive monetary stimulus.
The BoJ last month pushed back the timing for achieving its 2% inflation target, reinforcing expectations that it will lag other central banks in tightening monetary policy.
Sunday's national election will also grab some attention, as Japanese voters get set to deliver their verdict on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's nearly five years in power.
Media forecasts show Abe's gamble on the snap poll is likely to pay off, with his conservative Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition closing in on the two-thirds ""super majority"" it had in parliament's lower house before dissolution.
A hefty victory would raise the likelihood that Abe, who took office in December 2012 promising to bolster defense and reboot the economy, will win a third term as LDP leader next September and go on to become Japan's longest-serving premier.
5. Bank of Canada Rate Decision
The Bank of Canada's interest rate decision is due at 10:00AM ET (1400GMT) on Wednesday, with most experts expecting the central bank to hold its benchmark rate at 1.0%.
The BOC surprised many by hiking rates for the second consecutive time at its previous meeting in September.
Market odds of no move at this week's meeting rose to 81% from 73% after data on Friday showed that retail sales unexpectedly fell in August, pointing to a slowdown in growth after a hot first half of the year.
Still, many are betting the central bank will have room to hike again in December, with market odds at around 50%.

Ideas being considered even include delisting Chinese stocks from U.S. markets, according to Bloomberg News.

No love for the greenback amid slump to 13-month low 
The dollar slumped to its lowest level in over year against its rivals, amid a surge in the euro to 2-year highs after expectations grew that the European Central Bank (ECB) was edging closer to tapering its loose monetary policy while renewed U.S. political uncertainty weighed on sentiment. 
The euro raced to a 2-year high against the greenback rising 0.29% to $1.1666 on Friday, as traders dismissed ECB president Mario Draghi’s attempt to add a dovish slant on expectations that the ECB is poised to discuss tapering its bond-buying programme in September.
""We were unanimous in setting no precise date for when to discuss changes in the future,"" Draghi told a press conference Thursday. ""We simply said that our discussions should take place in the autumn.""
Adding to negative sentiment on the dollar were reports suggesting that U.S. President Donald Trump’s private business is set to come under scrutiny as special counsel Robert Mueller will expand investigations into allegations that Russia influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Gold notched biggest weekly gain in two weeks
Gold futures rose for the second-straight week, as heavy selling in the dollar and US political jitters fueled demand for the precious metal.
Gold’s recent stretch of gains comes in the wake of an uptick in safe-haven demand, following timid economic data suggesting that the Federal Reserve may struggle to keep to its plan to hike rates at least once more this year.
“Amid rising evidence of price and growth risks, [investors] are now being replaced by safe-haven buyers,” Peter Grant, chief market analyst with gold broker USAGOLD said.
Bitcoin tested record highs, Ethereum rallied after ‘Sunday slump’ 
Bitcoin spiked close to record highs on Friday, on the back of growing expectations that the digital currency will avert a possible split, after data showed that 93% of bitcoin miners had signalled their support for a key proposal aimed at improving the bitcoin network.
Earlier in the week, Bitcoin had slumped below $1,800 amid fears over the popular digital currency’s future, as investors were uncertain as to whether SegWit2x, a proposal aimed at speeding up transactions on the bitcoin network would garner enough support.
Ethereum, mirrored bitcoin’s move higher, snapping a four-week losing streak, after recovering from lows of $130.26 sustained on Sunday.
Oil erased gains to post weekly loss
Crude futures tumbled 2.5% on Friday, as investors questioned Opec’s commitment to reduce the glut in supply, after data surfaced showing that the oil-cartel’s supply was set to rise compared to June.
Prior to Friday’s slump, oil prices were set to notch a weekly gain, following a rally earlier during the week on the back of a report from the Energy Information Administration showing US crude stockpiles fell by more than expected.
The weekly loss comes ahead of an Opec meeting slated for July 24.
Nasdaq notched key milestone
As well as posting an all-time high on Thursday, the NASDAQ capped a 10-day winning streak for the first time since Feb 2015, buoyed by mostly upbeat corporate earnings.
The tech-heavy index rallied as better-than-expected earnings from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) offset a timid earnings report from  IBM  (NYSE:IBM).
Investor sentiment soured in the latter part of the week, however, as investors appeared reluctant to initiate large positions as equities remained close to record highs ahead of key earnings next week, including earnings from Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) after markets close Monday.",0.7096
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-friday-1928476,"Jul 19, 2019","Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, July 19:
1. Iran denies Trump claim of destroying drone, oil jumps
Oil prices jumped more than 2% overnight on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that the Navy destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz, a major chokepoint for global crude flows, again raising tensions in the Middle East.
Crude pared some of those gains however as Abbas Araqchi, Iranian deputy foreign minister, denied the report, saying that Tehran had “not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else” and said that the U.S. may in fact have shot down one of its own by mistake.
Escalating tensions in the Middle East have supported oil prices on speculation that they could impact supply.
2. U.S. stocks set to open higher on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Fed support
U.S. futures pointed to a higher open as better-than-expected earnings and cloud business revenue from Microsoft, along with hopes for policy easing from the Federal Reserve, supported sentiment
Wall Street closed higher on Thursday after New York Fed President John Williams said the central bank needed to “act quickly” when the economy was slowing and rates were low. Although he made no reference to the next move at the July 30-31 meeting, markets increased their bets for a 50 basis point to 46%. A quarter-point reduction is fully priced in.
Potentially adding fuel to the dovish fire, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will speak at an annual meeting of the Central Bank Research Association. Bullard was the only policymaker to dissent at the Fed’s June meeting based on his preference for a 25 basis point cut. However, he has since said he was unconvinced of the need for anything bigger.
In economic data, the University of Michigan will report its preliminary consumer sentiment index for July at 10:00 AM (14:00 GMT).
3. Boeing (NYSE:BA) to take $4.9 billion charge on 737 MAX grounding
Boeing has announced that it would take an after-tax charge of $4.9 billion for the second quarter ahead of releasing those earnings on July 24.
The company explained that the charge was to cover estimated disruptions from the ongoing grounding of its 737 MAX planes due to two fatal crashes. Various airlines have said they would seek compensation from Boeing.
Shares were still up nearly 2% in premarket trade and Morgan Stanley said the gain was an indication that investors were comfortable with the amount of the charge and Boeing’s production plans.
4. AB Inbev pulls in $11.3 billion from unit disposal
Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) saw shares rise more than 4% in premarket trade after announcing the sale of its Australian unit to Japan’s Asahi Group (T:2502) for $11.3 billion, including debt.
The move is a fallback option for the company, which has made cutting debt its top priority.
AB InBev canceled the IPO of its Asian businesses last week after trying to raise around $10 billion due to market conditions in what would have been the world’s largest listing of the year.
5.  WeWork  co-founder cashes out of $700 million ahead of IPO
Adam Neuman, co-founder of WeWork (NYSE:WEWK), has reportedly cashed out more than $700 million from the company through a mix of stock sales and debt, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter.
The amount was tagged as unusual, as founders typically tell after the company’s initial public offering.
The company is reportedly planning an analyst day on July 31 as its prepares for its IPO.
WeWork was recently valued at $47 billion in a private fundraising round, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world.

At 9:12 AM ET (13:12 GMT), gold futures for June delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, was little changed at $1,278.95 a troy ounce.
Gold is now up nearly 1% from the new low for 2019 that it hit earlier this week. However, momentum remains limited, as a string of healthy earnings reports from the U.S. keeps risk appetite well fed.
“Gold is taking record U.S. stocks and strong dollar pretty well,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at SaxoBank, said. “The momentum selling below $1,275 has so far failed to emerge leaving recently established shorts exposed on a potential break back above $1,281.”
Golds lack of movement on Thursday reflected opposing moves in U.S. equities. Dow futures were generally lower, while positive earnings from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) buoyed risk sentiment in tech.
After an initial knee-jerk reaction, gold and other financial markets brushed off Thursday’s economic data.
U.S. durable goods orders registered their best gain in eight months in March, underlining the recent role of the U.S. as an economic pillar of strength ahead of first quarter growth data out on Friday.
However, the labor market weakened a touch, according to weekly jobless claims. Americans filing for employment benefits increased by the most in 19 months last week. However, that is a rebound from their lowest level since 1969, posted last week

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/can-ibm-shares-continue-their-roll-1783847,"Feb 19, 2019","Investing.com - It may shock, but  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) shares are on something of a roll. The question is how long the roll will last.
The stock is up 21% this year, second among the 30 stocks in the Dow. Boeing (NYSE:BA) is tops, in part because Airbus Group (PA:AIR) is struggling and because traders are betting a U.S.-China trade deal will get done.
But IBM? This is a stock that fell 25% in 2018 and 7.6% in 2017 and has struggled to show revenue growth for years.
Maybe IBM has a few things going for it.
Most important is that, for now, investors seem willing to wait to see if CEO Ginni Rometty's bet on building a real cloud business comes to fruition. The business has been growing, but maybe not as quickly as some investors want. Revenue for the business grew 12% in the fourth quarter to $19.2 billion.
But IBM faces intense competition from players like Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure business and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud Platform.
The key is IBM's pending $34 billion acquisition of open-source cloud developer Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), expected in the latter half of the year. It's seen as the big fuel for the cloud business.
Add to that continued investments in analytics and artificial intelligence.
And IBM has real and long-standing relationships with the biggest players in the financial services industry that at least provides stable service revenue.
The stock began the year on the cheap side after hitting a 52-week low of $105.84 during the December market meltdown. Even now, its $1.57-a-share quarterly dividend represents a 4.6% yield, compared with the S&P 500's yield of about 2%. And the dividend doesn't seem to be at risk.
Technical indicators mostly rate the stock a buy. Its relative strength index, a measure of a stock's momentum, is about 60. A reading above 75 suggests it's overbought and vulnerable to a selloff.
But the proof ultimately will be real results, which may explain why the stock's up 2.7% in February, about even with the S&P 500 but trailing the Dow's 3.7% gain.",0.9724

1. Netflix tumbles as U.S. subscribers fall
Shares in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) plummeted 11% in pre-market trade Thursday as the company disappointed with quarterly subscriber numbers.
Not only did the online streaming service lose 126,000 subscribers in the U.S. during the second quarter, the first decline since 2011, it also managed to add only 2.7 million paid subscribers worldwide, far short of the Factset consensus of 5.3 million.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) suggested that the second quarter was a blip on its record, partly to be blamed by a lack of fresh content. It expects to bounce back in the third quarter with the release of the latest season of “Stranger Things”, new episodes for “The Crown” and the final season of “Orange is the New Black”. It projects 7 million paid subscriber additions worldwide.
2.  IBM  disappoints as  Morgan Stanley  , Microsoft step up
 IBM  (NYSE:IBM) appeared to add to tech disappointment, with shares off more than 1% in pre-market trade after its quarterly update on Wednesday. Although a positive performance in its cloud business helped push earnings above forecast, a fourth consecutive decline in group revenue for the quarter put pressure on the stock.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) will steal the spotlight on the earnings stage as it reports ahead of the opening bell.   Union Pacific   (NYSE:UNP) will also be closely watched after CSX's weak numbers earlier were taken as a proxy for the broader health of the real economy. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI), M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB), and Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) are also due to report.

Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings will then bring the focus back to tech after the market close. Traders will be watching for trends in its cloud division Azure, plans for the next Windows refresh and any updates on its competition with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a multi-billion dollar Pentagon contract.
3. Global stocks in the red as trade concerns dominate
Global shares traded lower on several signs that trade conflicts were taking a toll on economies and corporate earnings.
Wall Street ended at intraday lows Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal reported that Sino-U.S. trade talks are stalled over restrictions on Huawei, citing people familiar with negotiations.
Japan's exports slumped yet again, falling 6.7% in June, while manufacturers' confidence fell to a three-year low in July on the back of slowing Chinese growth.
The Bank of Korea unexpectedly cut interest rates for the first time in three years as Japan’s export controls on materials for South Korea’s chipmakers and the slowdown in China raised risks to Asia’s fourth-largest economy.
In Europe, software firm SAP (NYSE:SAP), the region’s most valuable tech stock by market cap, reported poor earnings and highlighted the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.
4. Jobless claims, Philly Fed survey and more Fed speeches
Beyond earnings from American firms, markets will receive readings on the U.S. labor market and regional manufacturing activity.
Weekly jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index for July will both be released at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
The influential New York Fed President John Williams will be on watch as he delivers a keynote address on monetary policy at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Central Bank Research Association. Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic is also scheduled for an appearance. 
5. Oil steadies, breaking 3-day loss
Oil prices traded slightly higher in early morning trade, breaking three straight days of declines.
Crude has been under pressure this week after Hurricane Barry caused less damage than expected to the Gulf of Mexico, suggesting that its impact on production will be short-lived.
Adding to this week’s selloff, data from the Energy Information Administration showed Wednesday that gasoline and distillate stockpiles surged last week, more than offsetting a slightly larger-than-expected draw on crude inventories.",-0.9789

1. Global stocks slide as falling oil prices dampen sentiment
Global stocks traded mostly down on Tuesday, as falling oil prices dampened demand for riskier assets.
Asian shares closed lower, as a downturn in crude oil curbed the enthusiasm from fresh record highs on Wall Street. However, stocks in Japan outperformed, with the Nikkei rising for the sixth straight session as markets reopened after a public holiday on Monday.
Meanwhile, European stock markets retreated from a three-week high on Tuesday, as weak oil prices and disappointing corporate earnings reports soured the investing mood.
Elsewhere, U.S. stock index futures pointed to a lower open on Tuesday morning, easing off from record levels, as investors looked ahead to a number of key earning reports while keeping an eye on oil prices.
2. Oil hovers near 2-month lows amid global supply glut
Oil prices added to overnight losses on Tuesday, falling back towards the lowest level in two months amid ongoing concerns over a global supply glut.
U.S. crude was down 14 cents, or 0.3%, to $45.80 a barrel, while Brent shed 13 cents, or 0.28%, to $46.83 a barrel.
Market players looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products. The American Petroleum Institute will release its inventories report later in the day, while Wednesday’s government report could show crude stockpiles fell by 2.3 million barrels.
3. Goldman Sachs reports Q2 earnings
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is set to report second quarter results at 11:30GMT, or 7:30AM ET, Tuesday morning. The bank is projected to report earnings of $3.04 a share on revenue of $7.58 billion.

4. German ZEW economic sentiment collapses in July
German economic sentiment deteriorated to the lowest level since November 2012 in July, as the Brexit shock hit business confidence, industry data showed on Tuesday.
The ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment plunged by 26.0 points to -6.8 this month from June’s reading of 19.2. Analysts had expected the index to drop by 10.2 points to 9.0 in July.
On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism.
5. Australian, New Zealand dollars sink on rate cut bets
The Australian and New Zealand dollars sank on Tuesday, as investors ramped up bets that both central banks could ease monetary policy as early as next month.
The Aussie tumbled to a more than one-week low of 0.7491 against the greenback, before recovering to 0.7502, down 1.2% on the day.
In the minutes of its July 5 board meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia signaled it may be ready to lower the cash rate further since its assessment is that inflation would remain quite low, but any move is dependent on incoming data.
The likelihood of an August rate cut has increased to 56% from 45% over the past week, derivatives indicate.
Meanwhile, the kiwi hit a three-week low of $0.7010 and was last trading at $0.7025, down 1.25%, after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand stepped up efforts to impose fresh curbs on a hot housing market - a move seen as raising the chance of a rate cut.

The ""temporary general license"" will be extended for Huawei for 90 days, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross confirmed. The extension would give U.S. companies more time to move away from Huawei products, Ross added. 
The ban was set to be reinstated on Monday and had raised feared that U.S. semiconductor companies may have to halt shipments to Huawei, a move that could not only hurt orders but exacerbate the chip inventory overhang that has plagued the sector.
The temporary reprieve added to investor hopes that the U.S. and China would increase efforts to engage in more constructive trade talks - following a recent uptick in threats by both nations - with President Donald Trump reportedly due to meet with U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad on Monday.

""I'm ready to go to 500,"" the president said in the full interview with CNBC that was released on Friday after previous parts regarding the Federal Reserve and the Chinese yuan had been pre-aired a day earlier.



In the interview, Trump claimed that America is being “taken advantage of” by China, the EU, Mexico, and Japan, because they all run trade surpluses with the US.
Specifically on China, Trump says America is “down a tremendous amount”, referring to a trade deficit of at least $375 billion and promised that he would fix it.
“I’m not doing this for politics, I’m doing this to do the right thing for our country. We have been ripped off by China for a long time,” Trump explained.
The U.S. has already imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, with another $200 billion being looked at. China has already retaliated with $34 billion of its own tariffs.
The strategy behind Trump’s move appeared to be to outstrip any possible retaliation as U.S. Census Bureau data showed that the U.S. only exported $129.9 billion to China in 2017.
“I raised ($50 billion), and they matched us. I said: ‘you don’t match us, you can’t match us because otherwise we’re always gonna be behind the A ball’,” Trump explained.
Trump dismisses negative impact on stocks
Trump also shrugged off worries about the negative impact on stock markets from escalating trade tensions.
CNBC pointed out that the mid-term elections were on the horizon and asked, “What if the stock market were to go down?”
“If it does, it does,” Trump responded, insisting that he was doing what was right for the American economy.
Indeed, U.S. stock futures took a dive in reaction to the news. Nasdaq 100 futures had been trading about 0.4% higher prior to the release as tech shares were supported by positive earnings from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). After briefly turning negative, they were last up 0.13% as of 7:00AM ET (11:00 GMT).

1. Microsoft’s Earnings Solid, but AMD Pummeled
After today’s tech stock hammering there will be one glimpse of hope for bulls following Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) strong earnings report after the bell.
Microsoft shares rose 4.5% in after-hours trading.
But the semiconductor sector will still be a major problem for the sector.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) reported revenue after the bell that was below Street forecasts and also guided revenue down. The stock had already been selling off on the day due to weak guidance from other chipmakers.
AMD stock plunged 17% after hours, adding to the 9% loss it saw in the regular session.
Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) impressed the market after reporting a strong profit when analysts were expecting a loss. Revenue also topped expectations.
The stock surged 12% postmarket.
2. Twitter Earnings on Tap Before the Bell
It’s a tech earnings extravaganza tomorrow, starting with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which is now reporting before the bell.
After the close of trading the major reports come from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Also ahead of trading there are earnings reports from healthcare, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), energy, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), communication services, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and transportation,  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP).
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and Dunkin (NASDAQ:DNKN) will also weigh in.
Disappointing earnings before the bell weighed on stocks throughout trading today, with investor concerns rising about in the impact of tariffs and trade battles and weak guidance in the tech sector.
3. More Housing Data, Durable Goods Orders Coming
The economic indicators heat up tomorrow, a day before the all-important GDP numbers arrive.
Attention will likely focus on housing again, following today’s disappointing new home sales figures.
The latest data on pending home sales will come at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists predict that pending home sales fell 0.1% in September, compared with a 1.8% decline in August.

Bitcoin fell 1.23% to $8,558 after hitting a high of $9,045.9.
The sharp reversal served as a stern reminder that the road to $10,000 for bitcoin will be fraught with headwinds as sellers continue to linger at key price levels.
Once the $10,000 mark has been breached, however, the floodgates will likely open, driving a wave of new funds into the market as traders, who were on the sidelines, scramble to get in on the rally, according to Tom Lee, global head analyst at Fundstrat.



But for the moment, traders are closely monitoring the $8,600 level, which some have earmarked as a technical support level, for signs of underlying demand.
Bitcoin's market cap, used to gauge appetite for the crypto, has risen from $60 billion in February to $152 billion in May, taking the total crypto market cap to $273 billion. Bitcoin's market cap is about the same size of Dow component McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). The market cap of crypto currencies in total is about 28% the size of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), currently the most valuable U.S. stock.
Despite today's slump, bitcoin remains on course to post its fourth-straight month of gains, a period during which it has more than doubled its market cap.
Still, the intraday reversal was mirrored by other cryptos, with XRP/USD down 1.77% to $0.44134, ETH/USD down 1.56% to $268.46 and LTC/USD shedding 4.40% to $112.27.",0.8638

https://www.investing.com/news/assorted/nvidia-triples-revenue-to-181-billion-in-q3-profits-soar-3240619,"Nov 21, 2023","The semiconductor leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has reported a remarkable performance in its third-quarter earnings, with revenues reaching $18.1 billion, a significant increase from the previous year, and profits soaring to $9.2 billion. This growth defies earlier forecasts by nearly $2 billion and marks a near-fourteenfold increase in profits year-over-year.
Nvidia's financial success comes amid a challenging landscape marked by competitive pressures, U.S. export restrictions affecting key markets such as China, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam, and the need for innovation in chip designs to remain compliant. Despite these hurdles, Nvidia's partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has continued to strengthen. The collaboration has boosted cloud offerings with Nvidia’s GPUs and co-developed supercomputing capabilities that now rank third globally.
The company's robust performance is partly attributed to increased production of the high-demand H100 chip, which is expected to drive Q4 sales towards an estimated $20 billion. This projection suggests sustained growth and optimism for Nvidia's near-term future.
In related industry news, the termination of Sam Altman from OpenAI and his subsequent hiring by Microsoft could signal potential shifts in the generative AI market. Insider Intelligence analysts hinted at possible volatility in this sector following these developments.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/few-ways-to-force-openai-governance-changes-3240610,"Nov 21, 2023","By Jody Godoy (Reuters) -Few people can force OpenAI to change governance at the crisis-stricken artificial-intelligence company, and the head of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a major financial backer, is not one of them, according to legal experts.  The nonprofit board overseeing the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot sent shock waves through Silicon Valley on Friday by abruptly firing Chief Executive Sam Altman. Nearly all of the company's 700 employees signed a letter threatening to resign if the board does not step down, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has called for governance changes. Microsoft did not immediately return a request for comment made after business hours on Tuesday. The turmoil has left investors weighing their legal options and illustrated a divide over how the potentially disruptive technology can be developed safely. Because it is a nonprofit, the only people who could force the current board of OpenAI to step down or change are judges or state attorneys general, said Alexander Reid, an attorney at BakerHostetler who counsels nonprofit organizations. Attorneys general oversee and investigate nonprofits, and have wide latitude to seek reforms. ""Even if they don't go to court, their mere presence typically gets results,"" he said. Attorneys general can enact everything from leadership changes to complete shutdown of an organization, usually after finding fraud or illegal conflicts of interest.  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY) is one example. The trust that controls the candymaker agreed in 2016 to replace certain board members after the Pennsylvania attorney general challenged the trust's spending. Darryll Jones, a law professor at Florida A&M University, said the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is another source of accountability. ""There is a whole boatload of scholarship noting that nonprofit enforcement is severely lacking, but for the most part nonprofits are pretty good at self-policing if only to avoid scandal that would impact donations,"" he said. OpenAI's for-profit arm was under the full control of a nonprofit, an arrangement meant to insulate decisions about a potentially powerful technology from being driven by corporate greed. Because of that, investors who have collectively plowed billions of dollars into the startup face hurdles to suing the board over Altman's firing, though sources have told Reuters some are considering legal action. Under OpenAI's bylaws, only directors can remove or elect new board members. The arrangement, known as a self-perpetuating board, is very common in the nonprofit world, said Reid. There are currently four people on the board: three independent directors, and OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. The latter worked with the other board members to remove Altman and former President Greg Brockman, but has since said he ""deeply regret(s)"" the action. Outside of government enforcers, Sutskever may now be the only person in a position to formally challenge the board's decision. Board members can sue other board members, either directly or on behalf of the organization, for failing to exercise their duties, said Reid. But typically such court battles are fought only when there is suspected malfeasance connected with spending or compensation, he said. In fights over organizational direction or control, the more common play is for the organization to split.  ""You just form another nonprofit that does it slightly differently,"" he said. OpenAI has already survived one such break. 
The cofounders of Anthropic, who were also executives at OpenAI until 2020, had broken from their employer over disagreements regarding how to ensure AI's safe development and governance. Whether OpenAI survives the rift between its board and employees will likely be determined in the next few days.",-0.9167

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower at 21,987. The S&P 500 closed 0.20% higher while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 6435, up 0.10%. The three main U.S. indices posted a monthly gain in August. 
US stocks made a positive start to September, as investors mulled over several economic reports including a nonfarm payrolls report showing the US economy created fewer jobs than expected in August.
The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index in August climbed to 58.8% from 56.3% in July. That is the highest reading since April 2011.
The U.S. economy created 156,000 jobs in August, missing consensus estimates for the creation of 180,000 jobs.
The jobless rate unexpectedly rose in August to 4.4% while average hourly earnings fell short of expectations, slowing to 0.1% from 0.3% in the prior month.
The dip in jobs and wage growth, however, failed to curb expectations of a third rate later this year as some analysts said it would take a series of “horrendous” payrolls data for the fed to abandon its plan to hike rates once more this year.
Also supporting the move higher in equities was a surge in energy stocks, after two refineries began to restart, narrowing the ‘crack spread’ – the difference between crude oil and gasoline prices – from recent highs.
Sentiment on US stocks remains positive, following earlier data during the week showing U.S. GDP in the second quarter rose 3.0%, boosting investor expectations of solid third-quarter economic growth.

The major averages have fallen back after hitting new highs in July, mostly because of the Trump Administration's threats to impose new tariffs on imports from China starting Sept. 1. Despite Friday's gains, the Dow was off 5.5% from its July peak, with the S&P 500 down 4.6% and the Nasdaq down 5.3%. 
The trade tensions eased a bit after President Donald Trump agreed to delay tariffs on many products, especially electronics and other consumer goods ahead of the holiday shopping season. They seemed to ease more on Friday if only because there were few ugly tweets or other pronouncements.

1. Fed's Powell to testify before Congress
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will be the focus of attention as he delivers his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT) Tuesday.
The testimony will allow Powell the opportunity to express his outlook on the future path of interest rates with less than three weeks to go before the next policy decision.
Although markets still price in a 25 basis point cut at the end of July policy meeting, a strong reading of the U.S. labor market from the monthly jobs report released last Friday has led investors to scale back expectations for more aggressive easing.
Fed funds futures no longer predict a larger half-point cut at the end of July and the implied odds for a total of three decreases in the remainder of the year have steadily decreased to below 50%.
2. Global stocks show caution ahead of Powell testimony
Global stocks traded lower on Wednesday amid uncertainty over what guidance Powell will give for U.S. monetary policy.
U.S. futures pointed to a slightly lower open. Dow futures fell 58 points, or 0.2%, by 5:52 AM ET (9:52 GMT), S&P 500 futures lost 7 points, or 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 23 points, or 0.3%.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was seen as the clear favorite when the Defense Department laid out its needs back in 2017, but AP suggested that allegations by another bidder, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), that the Pentagon has unfairly favored Amazon may throw a wrench in the works.
Although Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) was, along with   IBM   (NYSE:IBM), removed from the list of candidates in an earlier round, the company’s court hearing is scheduled to start Wednesday, giving it a final chance to make its case against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
4. Oil prices jump ahead of EIA inventory data
Oil prices jumped more than 1% in early morning trade on Wednesday, after The American Petroleum Institute reported an enormous crude oil inventory draw of 8.13 million barrels for the week ending July 4.
Markets await the official government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that will be released at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT) Wednesday.
Forecasts point to a draw of 3.08 million barrels, in what, if confirmed, would be a fourth straight weekly drop, extending a bullish - if largely seasonal - trend on inventories.
5. BoC expected to hold, Mexican finance minister resigns
Although Powell will steal the market spotlight on Wednesday, financial headlines in America’s neighbors Canada and Mexico could also sway the dollar.
The Bank of Canada is expected to leave interest rates unchanged and raise its forecast for economic growth, in what would be a marked contrast to peers such as the Fed, European Central Bank or Reserve Bank of Australia.
On the U.S. southern border, Mexico's finance minister, Carlos Urzúa, quit abruptly on Tuesday, sending a scathing resignation letter that talked of “discrepancies in economic matters” and criticized policy decisions that were made without sufficient economic evidence. The Mexican peso continued to slide on Wednesday amid worry over the impact.",0.2943

In spite of a late rally, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 125 on Friday -- marking the third time out of the last four weeks that it has closed lower. The NASDAQ Composite index and the S&P 500 Composite index also closed down on Friday, as the sell-off for the month intensifies.
On the Dow, only two stocks closed in green territory as it fell 145.91 points or 0.82% to 17,749.31. The NASDAQ Composite index lost 0.49% or 21.53 points to close at 4,871.76, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.61% or 12.55 to 2,053.40.

As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its Federal Funds Rate at its current rate between zero and 0.25% on Wednesday, leaving its benchmark short-term rate unchanged for the 53rd consecutive meeting. Nearly a decade has passed since the Fed last hiked interest rates.
The Fed reiterated that it would like to see improvements in the labor market and inflation moved toward its targeted goal of 2% before it starts to raise rates.
""The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment,"" the FOMC said in its July monetary policy statement. ""The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market."" In June, the U.S. unemployment rate declined 0.2% to 5.3.

As a result, the Dow Jones Industrial extended it current losing streak to its sixth straight session, falling at one point to its lowest level since February.

Shares in Viacom B Inc (NASDAQ:VIAB), for instance, plunged more than 20% on Thursday following the release of worse than expected second quarter earnings, reflecting viewers' penchant for shifting to video-streaming services such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)to fulfill their appetite for entertainment programming.
On the Dow,  Chevron  Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corporation (NYSE:XOM) finished as the top performers in spite of the continued decline in crude prices.

Apple finished Tuesday's session as the worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and among the weakest performers on the NASDAQ Composite Index after falling by as much as 4.4% on the day. Apple shares closed on Tuesday at $114.66, down 3.78 or 3.19% on the session. Since reporting worse than expected earnings for its third quarter of fiscal year 2015 on July 21, Apple has seen its stock decline by roughly 12%. Apple shares are also down approximately 15% after reaching an all-time high of 134.54 in April.

While analysts continue to struggle to pinpoint the origins of Apple's precipitous fall, Tuesday's sell-off could be attributed to the ramifications of a report that surfaced one session earlier. The report from Business Insider, quoting sources close to Apple, said the tech giant is in talks with U.S. and European telecommunications companies to offer its mobile phone service on a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) basis. Under the reported proposal, a user would pay Apple for all calls, texts and other data instead of paying a carrier such as Verizon or T-Mobile. Apple officials denied the MVNO service operating report.
The top performer on the Dow was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which added 0.82 or 1.75% to 47.63.

The worst performer was  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK), which plunged more than 14% to 106.59, after the Irish drugmaker downgraded its sales forecasts for its HP Achtar Gel on Tuesday. Last year, the drug company acquired Questcor, the manufacturer of the gel for $5.6 billion.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 24651. The S&P 500 closed 0.9% higher, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 6936.58, up 1.17%.

Rubio earlier this week, had said he would not approve the GOP tax plan unless it raises the refundable portion of the child tax credit currently at $1,100.
The final tax bill is expected to include a plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, fueling optimism that corporate earnings would likely receive a boost, spurring a broader rally in sectors believed to be the main beneficiaries of lower taxes.
On the economic front, investors mulled over economic reports on industrial production and manufacturing that fell short of expectations.

Leading technology stocks capped a positive end to the session, with Facebook, Amazon, and Amazon gaining more than 1%, paring some of the losses observed in the tech sector over the past month.
Later during the session, investor focus shifted to monetary policy as the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June meeting was released.
The minutes showed that the recent slowdown in inflation didn’t deter the Federal Reserve from its stance of raising rates gradually, as most members expect that inflation will rise to central bank’s target of 2% in 2019.
The minutes lifted sentiment on an interest rate hike later this year, pushing financial, mostly bank stocks higher offsetting a slump in energy stocks in the wake a 4% decline in crude prices.
The minutes came after U.S. factory order data undershot expectations, falling to 0.8% in May, compared to expectations of a 0.5% decline

U.S. stocks made a mixed start to the week, as sentiment on corporates earnings remained bullish, after data from Factset on Friday showed 73% of the S&P 500 companies that had reported earnings as of last week, beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Some analysts suggested, however, that the recent bull run in the main U.S. indexes could come under pressure, as corporate earnings in the second half of the year may struggle match expectations.
""We're probably seeing peak earnings,"" said Ed Keon, managing director and portfolio manager at QMA, a multi-asset manager in Newark, New Jersey. ""I think we'll be a little slower in the second half.""

In what was the final trading day of the quarter, risk sentiment spiked as investors piled in stocks despite mixed economic reports on consumer spending and inflation.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1% last month. The commerce department said Friday.
Inflation, however remained subdued, as the core personal consumption expenditures price index slowed to 1.3% in August from 1.4% in July. The core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and has a 2 percent target.
On the political front, investors weighed the possibility of a new Federal Reserve chair amid speculation surrounding the future of Janet Yellen’s position after both President Donald Trump and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reportedly met with Kevin Warsh to discuss the possibility of his nomination to replace Janet Yellen.

The top performer on the Dow was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which gained 1.02 or 2.19% to 47.61. Apple also rose 2.43 or 1.87% to 32.05, after news broke that the tech giant will extend its popular mobile app to its new iWatch device. The worst performer on the Dow was  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), which fell 0.58 or 0.56% to 102.84.

More than two years have elapsed since U.S. equity markets have posted a weekly winning streak as lengthy as its current rally. It also marked the first time the major indices have finished with five straight weeks of at least 1% gains since the start of the bull market in March, 2009.
Investors continued to react to a surprisingly dovish outlook from the Federal Reserve earlier this week when the U.S. central bank cut its interest rate forecast through 2018. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for equities, as investors pile into less risky bonds and U.S. Treasuries to capitalize on higher yields.
Meanwhile, the expiration of four major asset classes in what is commonly referred to as a ""quadruple witching hour,"" had little impact on stock prices on Friday. Quadruple witching hours, which occur on the third Friday of March, June, September and December, involve the expiration of market index futures, stock index futures, stock options and market options, usually resulting in increased volatility.

The blue-chip Dow futures dropped 43 points, or 0.25%, by 11:02AM GMT, or 7:02AM ET, the S&P 500 futures traded down 5 points, or 0.25%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures lost 8 points, or 0.17%.
Since the surprisingly dovish stance taken by the U.S. central bank at the last meeting on March 16 where they cut forecasts for the number of rate hikes in half to just two this year, a string of Fed members have raised their voice, suggesting a more hawkish stance on monetary policy.
In this light, investors will pay close attention to Yellen who will give a speech to the Economic Club of New York at 15:30GMT, or 11:30AM ET, in the hopes that the Fed chair can explain the apparent divide between Fed hawks and doves.
Apart from Kansas City Fed president Esther George who dissented on the last decision due to her belief that the central bank should raise rates, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker recently stated that the central bank should consider another interest rate hike as early as next month and added that he would prefer at least three hikes before year-end.
Both San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart also indicated that a rate hike could come as early as next month.
Most experts expect Yellen to re-emphasize on Tuesday her previous insistence that all meetings were “live”, meaning that rate decisions could happen at any point in time, though markets place low odds on any action happening in April.
Meanwhile, and despite Monday’s dismal downward revision to January’s personal spending that caused the Atlanta Fed to slash U.S. first quarter GDP growth forecasts to 0.6%, from the prior 1.4%, SF Fed chief Williams said earlier on Tuesday that his outlook on the U.S. economy was positive and reiterated that rate hikes would be “gradual and thoughtful”.
After Yellen’s speech, New York Fed chief William Dudley and Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan will speak at 16:00GMT, or 12:00ET, and 17:00GMT, or 13:00ET, respectively.
Apart from the Fed, the economic calendar will see the release of the S&P/Case-Shiller house price index for January at speak at 13:00GMT, or 9:00AM ET, along with the Conference Board’s consumer confidence for March at 14:00GMT, or 10:00AM ET.
Additionally, oil prices fell on Tuesday among fears that the rebound from February’s low has run its course with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts suggesting that the barrel of crude could return to near $30.
Concerns were also raised while waiting for inventory data which could show that U.S. stockpiles rose once again to record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly inventory data on Tuesday at 20:35GMT, or 16:35ET, while the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration will publish its report on Wednesday at 14:30GMT, or 10:30AM ET.

Apple shares fell more than 4.2%, one day after the world's largest company missed analysts' forecasts with its iPhone and iPad shipments during the second quarter. Although Apple shipped more than 47 million iPhones and 10.9 million iPads during the period, the company slightly missed analysts' expectations in both sales categories.

The worst performer was San Diego-based gene sequencing company Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN), which dipped 20.05 or 8.44% to 217.49.
Intuitive Surgical also finished as the top performer on the S&P 500, just ahead of  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG), which gained 52.75 or 7.84% to 725.82. On Tuesday, Chipotle increased its quarterly revenues by 14% on a yearly basis. Investors are also encouraged by the return of carnitas meat to all of its American restaurants by the fourth quarter, after the company inked a deal with a new supplier to provide ""responsibly raised pork."" 
The worst performer was oil and gas equipment services company FMC Technologies (NYSE:FTI), which fell 3.62 or 9.95% to 32.75. WTI crude futures continued their steady decline throughout the summer, falling below $50 a barrel for the first time since early-April on Wednesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower at 22295. The S&P 500 closed 0.22% lower while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 6370.59, down 0.88%.
Investors fled risky assets in search of safe-havens such as gold and the yen, as tensions on the Korean Peninsula spiked as North Korea upped its threats against the U.S. on Monday.
“The whole world should clearly remember it was the US who first declared war on our country."" North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong said in reference to President Donald Trump’s tweet that “North Korea won’t be around much longer”.
""Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country,"" Ri said.
That added to earlier geopolitical uncertainty from Europe in the wake of elections in Germany which saw support for German chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative alliance slump to its lowest since 1949.
Despite securing a fourth term as German chancellor, Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union had their worst election showing since 1949, ceding ground to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Following the result, some analysts questioned whether the disappointing result would complicate Merkel’s efforts to stitch together a complicated three-way coalition that can withstand pressure from the anti-immigration AfD party.
“Though the presence of the AfD should not significantly impact German intentions regarding the EU in the immediate future, the rising populism dampened the mood in the euro markets,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at LCG, in a note to clients.
On the corporate front, shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell for the fourth-straight session, weighing on the broader tech sector, as the tech giant continues to struggle to shake off recent criticism of its latest smartwatch the Apple Watch 3.

Shares of both JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) fell more than 1%, dragging the broader market into negative territory.
On the economic data front, labor market and wholesale inflation data topped expectations pointing to underlying strength in the U.S. economy.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims fell 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended Oct. 7, beating forecasts of a 7,000 decline.
In a separate report, the U.S. Department of Labor said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4% in September. In the 12 months through September, the PPI rose 2.2% after rising 2% in August.
Analysts have been quick to downplay the slump in U.S. stocks, insisting the recent upward trend in markets is not at risk of reversing as earnings will reflect strong fundamentals.
“Basic fundamentals are good, companies are making money, and I think the market will be relatively strong throughout earnings season, but I don’t see a huge spike up between now and the end of the year because a lot [of earnings optimism] has been priced in,” said Gary Droz, managing director at MainLine Private Wealth.

Investors also kept a close eye on health care stocks, which closed about 3% higher for the week ahead of the Senate’s vote on a healthcare bill next week, which aims to repeal and replace Obamacare. 
A flurry of comments from Federal Reserve officials failed to draw significant moves in equity markets as St. Louis Fed President James Bullard was the only Fed official who commented on monetary policy.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1656400,"Oct 23, 2018","Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. AT&T, Boeing, UPS Lead Tomorrow’s Earnings
There’s no slowing down with earnings tomorrow morning.
Among closely-watched names will be Boeing (NYSE:BA) and UPS (NYSE:UPS), with earnings from both companies expected to rise from the year-ago period.
Investors will look to Boeing’s results for any indications of increased input costs, as seen by fellow Dow component  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT). And UPS’ earnings will give some more color on how companies with exposure to China are faring during trade battles.
AT&T (NYSE:T) will report a day after rival Verizon (NYSE:VZ) topped subscriber numbers. But investors may be more interested in the company’s content plans with Time Warner than how much the new iPhone helped its bottom line.
After the bell, tech heavyweights Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will report.
And Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also on the calendar. The company’s shares climbed today after longtime short-selling nemesis made a turnaround and gave a thumbs up to Tesla.
2. New Home Sales Numbers Coming
If earnings aren’t enough, the economic calendar is heavier tomorrow, with a focus on housing data.
The recent housing numbers have been disappointing and many look on the sector as an early indication of broader economic weakness.
New home sales numbers for September arrive at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that sales of new homes last month edged up slightly to an annual rate of 630,000.
At 9:45 AM ET, Markit’s preliminary measures of manufacturing and services activity are issued. The manufacturing PMI for October is expected to edge down slightly, with the services PMI is forecast to rise from the previous month.
3. Oil Inventories Expected to Have Risen Again
Crude oil had a wild ride today, but not for the reason many expected.
Instead of prices jumping on Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s speech about the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, they tumbled as Saudi Arabia went on the front foot and promised as much oil as was needed.
While tensions between Saudi and the West are certainly not over, it was enough of a signal to quell some market fears about a supply shortage when Iranian sanctions kick in.
Prices could sink further if the EIA reports another outsize build in U.S. oil inventories.
Analysts expect that the U.S. crude oil stockpile rose by about 3.7 million last week.",-0.9683

At 11:05AM ET (15:05GMT), the Dow Jones dropped 17 points, or 0.08%, the S&P 500 inched up 1 point, or 0.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite edged forward 4 points, or 0.06%.
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) led losses on the Dow with shares sinking 4%. Experts blamed the slide on the announcement that Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD) had reached an agreement to sell home appliances on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), one of the blue-chip home improvement retailers best categories.
The Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) were the next largest decliners have reporting quarterly earnings.
On the opposite side of the index,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) saw shares jump 2% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the firm to overweight on expectations that sales growth will improve with new products.
Dow components Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Visa (NYSE:V) were scheduled to report after the market close.
On the economic front, weekly jobless claims rose less than expected, holding near 40-year lows, though the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey deteriorated much more than forecast.
Elsewhere, the euro rose to almost two-year highs against the U.S. dollar on Thursday after European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said the bank would discuss the next steps in its monetary stimulus program in the fall.
Also in monetary policy, the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy on hold overnight and pushed back the timeline for hitting its inflation target.
Meanwhile, oil prices continued to move higher on Thursday, supported by the larger than expected U.S. inventory draw in the previous session.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.86 or 0.14% to 17,829.73, while the S&P 500 Composite index added 5.65 or 0.27% to 2,088.90, each extending gains from Monday's rally. On the S&P 500, six of 10 sectors closed in the green, as stocks in the Energy, Telecommunications and Technology industries led. Stocks in the Basic Materials and Health Care sector lagged, each closing in negative territory for the day. Both the Dow and S&P 500 remain about 2% below their all-time highs. The NASDAQ Composite index, meanwhile, rose by 6.55 or 0.14% to 4,843.76, driven by strong performances fromMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
For the most part, investors shrugged off remarks by Yellen before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday in her first public appearance since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left interest rates steady and lowered their long-term outlook at last week's June monetary policy meeting. In prepared remarks, Yellen indicated that the FOMC will maintain a cautious approach to monetary policy, amid an uneven economic growth outlook and widespread uncertainty in the labor market. Yellen also emphasized that a U.K. departure from the European Union could have serious consequences on global and U.S. financial markets by triggering a ""risk-off"" environment that could create a spike in the dollar.
The top performer on the Dow was Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which surged 1.32 or 2.64% to 51.39. It came as the tech giant unveiled its Microsoft Wallet app on Tuesday, a card-based payment technology that will become available to customers worldwide later this summer. The technology, which will be usable in over a million retail locations, aims to make mobile payments simpler for users with Windows 10 mobile devices, Microsoft said in a statement. The worst performer was Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which lost 0.98 or 0.74% to 131.77. Boeing (NYSE:BA) closed just below McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), which fell 0.79 or 0.64% to 122.63. Shares in McDonalds are virtually flat since the fast-food chain announced plans last week to move its corporate headquarters to Chicago by the Spring, 2018.
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), which added 0.44 or 3.57% to 12.76 amid reports that Samsung (KS:005930) could cut its Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) supply over the second half of the year. It comes as Micron looks to shift its reliance on DRAM semiconductor memory technology to 3D NAND and 3DX Point platforms, which are newer and reportedly provide more stability. Tech stocks performed admirably on Tuesday, as  Western Digital  Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) and Cerner Corporation (NASDAQ:CERN) all rose by more than 2%. The worst performer was Endo International, which slumped 0.63 or 3.92% to 15.44. Over the last year, shares in the specialty drugmaker are down nearly 80%.
The top performer on the S&P 500 was  Marathon Oil  Corporation (NYSE:MRO), which gained 0.62 or 4.28% to 15.10. While U.S. crude futures halted a three-day winning streak in Tuesday's session, North Sea Brent pared earlier losses to close above $50 a barrel. The worst performer was Williams Companies Inc (NYSE:WMB), which fell 1.26 or 5.65% to 21.06.

Investors are still hunting for new AI products that could help consumers interact better with the technology and address deep tech issues such as brain computer interface, they said. The owner of the wildly popular ChatGPT chatbot earlier this week unveiled a marketplace that allows users to access personalized AI ""apps"" for tasks like teaching math or designing stickers. The news sparked fear among AI startup founders who worry they will not be able to compete with OpenAI, which is trying to build an AI empire with products aimed at both consumers and enterprises. ""There's so much room for continued innovation in AI. We're in an intermediary step in a decades-long revolution,"" Konstantine Buhler, partner at Sequoia Capital, told the conference. ""You can play a very big role in how this is shaped."" Sequoia invested in OpenAI in 2021, the maker of ChatGPT, in which Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also has a larger stake. Avery Klemmer, investor at Thrive Capital, which recently increased its investment in OpenAI, also said she sees opportunities for the rise of consumer applications beside ChatGPT. She expects more innovations based on the existing format of AI chatbots popularized by ChatGPT.  ""I think there will be really novel formats and forms of engagement that get invented,"" Klemmer said. Despite recent frenzied investments into the technology by companies and venture capital firms, analysts and investors say development of AI products is still in the early stages. 
While it's still relatively expensive to build applications using large language models, the accelerated pace of research in the space could result in a rapid decline in the cost of AI inference, or using an AI model to make predictions, and inspire new products, Jill Chase, partner at CapitalG, told Reuters NEXT.  ""The cost of inference coming down so dramatically may seem like a small thing, but it's hugely impactful for what types of businesses can be created and what use cases incumbents can empower,"" she said.",0.9566

The data management company reported a 25% growth in total ARR, adjusted for foreign exchange impact, and emphasized the importance of its AvePoint Confidence Platform in promoting generative AI adoption in enterprises. 
Key takeaways from the call include:
 The company's total revenues for Q3 were $72.8 million, including a 40% YoY growth in SaaS revenue.
 AvePoint ended the quarter with $209.3 million in cash and short-term investments.
* The company reported a gross margin of 73.7% and non-GAAP operating income of $9.3 million, representing an operating margin of 12.8%.
* AvePoint raised its full-year expectations for total ARR, total revenue, and operating income.
* The company's net revenue retention rate (NRR) reached 108% in Q3, showing improvement from the previous quarter.
 Q4 total revenues are expected to be between $70.5 million and $72.5 million, with non-GAAP operating income ranging from $8.1 million to $9.1 million.
 Full-year total ARR is expected to be between $261 million and $263 million, with total revenues ranging from $267.7 million to $269.7 million.
AvePoint's strong Q3 performance was bolstered by customer wins and expansions, including a large US Federal agency and a global financial service company. The company also highlighted its focus on the channel as a key driver of profitable growth.
Despite a challenging and uncertain demand environment, AvePoint continues to see growth across all customer segments. The company's focus on profitable growth and leverage across the business has resulted in margin expansion. Cloud optimization and AI are key areas of focus for the company.
Looking ahead, AvePoint projected a 22% growth in ARR for calendar 2023, with a slight improvement due to favorable foreign exchange rates. The company aims to improve its gross revenue retention rate, which currently stands at 87%, through initiatives focused on customer engagement and behavior analysis. The enterprise segment has the highest retention rate, while the mid-market and SMB segments have slightly lower rates.
The company's optimism about its future growth opportunities in the digital workplace and AI markets was apparent during the earnings call. AvePoint's focus on cloud optimization, cost management, and the increasing demand for AI solutions, particularly in security and copilot readiness, are expected to drive future growth.InvestingPro InsightsAvePoint's performance can be further nuanced by a look at some key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, a healthy sign of financial stability, and its liquid assets exceed short term obligations, providing a safety net for unforeseen expenses or investments (InvestingPro Tips 0, 4).
However, it's worth noting that AvePoint has not been profitable over the last twelve months, and two analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period (InvestingPro Tips 1, 5). This suggests a cautious outlook, despite the company's robust Q3 performance and optimistic projections.
From a market perspective, AvePoint has a high return over the last year (InvestingPro Tip 3) and is trading near its 52-week high (InvestingPro Tip 6). The company's adjusted market cap stands at 1370M USD, and it has experienced a significant price uptick over the last six months (InvestingPro Data).

James Arestia: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to AvePoint's third quarter 2023 earnings call.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, a substitute for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is available in our third quarter 2023 earnings press release as well as our updated investor presentation, both of which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Lastly, we have added an Excel file containing our historical financial metrics to the IR website for ease of reference. With that, let me turn the call over to TJ.
Tianyi Jiang: Thanks, Jamie, and thank you to every one joining us on the call today. Q3 was another strong quarter for AvePoint, as we again meaningfully outperformed our guidance for both total revenue and non-GAAP operating margins while delivering total ARR growth of 25% after adjusting for the impact of FX. Jim will spend more time on our third quarter results and updated guidance, but I would like to spend today discussing the inflection point we currently face and why we are so excited about the many opportunities ahead of us.

SISO's: I hear this concern in every conversation with customers and partners and more formal studies also back this up. 89% of executives say that high quality data is essential, but 75% of them don't trust their data and 66% believe they're below average in managing the information lifecycle, properly governing the data and ensuring its compliance. For AI projects to succeed, organizations must address these data challenges by applying key strategies to better manage, clean and enrich their data. This is where the power of AvePoint Confidence platform comes in and why we believe AvePoint can be a key enabler of generative AI adoption within enterprises in the coming years. On a daily basis, we manage more than 250 petabytes of data for our customers and partners, enabling them to modernize, control and apply resilience to their data management practices. And we have a proven time tested playbook to do so, which is only becoming more relevant with the desire to leverage AI across businesses of all sizes around the world. Specifically, these are the steps we take with the AvePoint Confidence Platform. One, we bring together data from all repositories and sources across the enterprise. Two, we ensure that the data is properly classified and intact. And three, we implement the correct lifecycle and access controls for that data.
shifthappens: With AvePoint Opus, organizations can manage their information and ensure compliance, optimize cloud storage and streamline data management processes, all of which are essential to the AI focused ambitions of our customers and prospects. We're excited about our roadmap for AI Power Solutions and you'll hear more from us on new products and enhancements to our existing offerings that will drive even more customer value. Let's discuss a couple of customer wins and expansions in the third quarter that show how we are not only helping organizations establish that solid data foundation, but also helping them extract more value from that data to reduce costs, improve productivity and make more informed business decisions. One of our most notable customer expansion in Q3 was a large U.S. Federal agency, a long time AvePoint customer. They faced several challenges in meeting their stringent compliance, governance and security requirements for their 95,000 users as they moved to the cloud. With AvePoint Confidence platform the agency can address its complex record management needs including data [ph] compliance and data protection, identify and secure a sensitive data and implement the proper controls over its workspace provisioning and lifecycle management of their productivity environment, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 365 and Power Platform. This competitive win also unlocks future opportunities as we're already in talks with them to accelerate their migration of remaining self-hosted assets to Microsoft 365, implement Information Lifecycle Management with AvePoint Opus and transform analytics into workplace insights with tyGraph. One of the world's largest financial service company has been a long time customer of our Control and Modernization suite and in the third quarter came to us for help reducing high capacity and consumption costs for their citizen developer platform. They purchased AvePoint Power and now have better visibility into their local no code application development and license usage of Microsoft Power platform allowing them to optimize their resources and save on cost for their 106,000 users.
generative: In Q3 a United Kingdom based public sector agency needed a comprehensive solution to protect its increasing amount of data for Microsoft 365. After purchasing AvePoint Secure Backup Service Solution, the customer can implement robust resilience for data generated by its 123,000 users. And this new customer is already considering extending this security to their Microsoft Azure investment in order to provide comprehensive protection across their entire digital workplace environment. I'm extremely proud of the team for another strong quarter in closing new customer wins and existing customer expansions and just want to spend a moment discussing the channel, which as you know is a key pillar of our strategy to drive profitable growth. Our investment in AI and proven ability to create a robust and secure data strategy will not only benefit our customers, but it will also provide significant value to our expanding partner network. By integrating more AI capabilities into our technology our partners will be equipped with smarter, more automated tools to manage and protect their clients' data and collaboration environments. Ultimately, this will reduce complexity and optimize costs for our partners, enabling them to better focus on delivering strategic solutions tailored to enhance the customer experience. We're entering the next phase of generative AI where the focus is shifting from scaling models to building products that solve real business problems and transform the customer experience. The key to doing this effectively is by having a robust data management strategy, which is the core business problem AvePoint has solved throughout its 22-year history and then integrating AI to fully harness its potential. We'll continue to update you as we execute the product roadmap for AI powered solutions that transform and enrich data to provide perfectly tailored experiences for our customers. As a whole, my remarks today make clear we are well positioned to help companies adapt and compete in today's dynamic business and technology landscape as the value provided by the AvePoint Confidence Platform is critical to the success of AI ambitions of companies around the world. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to discuss our financial results in more detail.
James Caci: Thank you, TJ, and good afternoon everyone. As we review our strong third quarter results today, let me remind you that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to non-GAAP metrics. For the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, total revenues were $72.8 million, up 16% year-over-year and once again above the high end of our guidance. Within total revenue, third quarter SaaS revenue was $41.9 million as our fastest growing revenue segment grew 40% year-over-year and in Q3 SaaS comprised 58% of total revenues compared to 48% a year ago. Looking at the business geographically, our solid performance was once again driven by the growth in our SaaS business. In North America, SaaS revenues grew 28% year-over-year and represented 57% of North America revenues, which in turn grew 8% year-over-year. In EMEA, SaaS revenues grew 51% year-over-year and represented 72% of EMEA revenues, which in turn grew 14% year-over-year. And in APAC SaaS revenues grew 50% year-over-year and represented 43% of APAC revenues, which in turn grew 35% year-over-year. Total ARR surpassed the $0.25 billion dollar mark this quarter as we ended Q3 at $250.6 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 23% and growth of 25% when adjusted for the impact of FX. Net new ARR in the third quarter was $14.4 million representing year-over-year growth of 14% after adjusting for the $3 million of ARR that we added in the prior year period through the acquisition of tyGraph. And as we look at ARR geographically, we are pleased that year-over-year growth for all three regions was generally in line with total reported ARR growth as we saw another strong quarter of execution by our sales teams. Continuing with ARR and the metrics we assess against several key growth strategies, we ended the third quarter with 518 customers with ARR of over $100,000. That's up 16% from the prior year period. As of the end of Q3 50% of our total ARR came through the channel compared to 47% a year ago and for Q3 specifically, 72% of our incremental ARR came through the channel compared to 61% for Q2. As discussed at our Investor Day in March, the channel contribution to our incremental ARR may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but we expect the channel contribution to total ARR to continue increasing each quarter. In turn, this should continue driving ARR growth and operating efficiencies as we have seen through the first three quarters of this year. Turning now to our customer retention metrics, adjusted for the impact of FX, our trailing 12-month gross retention rate for the third quarter was 87%, in line with what we reported at the end of Q2. And looking at our net retention rate, we saw another strong contribution from our existing customer base in Q3, highlighted by several of the expansion examples TJ just discussed. This led to another improvement in NRR versus the prior quarter as this metric was 108% in Q3 compared to 107% at the end of Q2 after adjusting for the impact of FX. On a reported basis, Q3 GRR was 85% and in line with Q2 GRR, while NRR improved from 104% in Q2 to 107% in Q3. To remind you, our medium term target for gross retention rate is 90% plus and for net retention rate is 110% to 115%. Turning back to the income statement, gross profit for the quarter was $53.7 million, representing a gross margin of 73.7% compared to 74% in Q3 of 2022 and 71.1% in Q2 of 2023. We are pleased that our gross margin remained in line with last year and improved versus the prior quarter. Going forward, we would expect to see improvements in our overall gross margin as services, which is our lowest margin business, continues to become a smaller portion of our revenue base. Moving down the income statement, we are pleased that Q3 operating expenses were flat year-over-year totaling $44.3 million or 61% of revenues. This compares to $44 million or 70% of our revenues a year ago. As a result, Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $9.3 million or an operating margin of 12.8%, well above the high end of our guidance. This compares to operating income of $2.4 million a year ago or an operating margin of 3.8%. We continue to show leverage across the business, especially in the sales and marketing and general administrative lines, which, as we discussed at our Investor Day were the biggest areas of opportunity for us. Overall, our sustained focus on profitable growth drove year-over-year margin expansion of approximately 900 basis points in the third quarter. Turning next to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we ended the third quarter with $209.3 million in cash and short-term investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash generated from operations was $13.3 million while free cash flow was $11.8 million. This compares to cash used of $6.9 million and free cash flow of negative $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Taken together, our strong cash balance and our ongoing cash flow generation provide ample flexibility as we constantly evaluate our capital allocation priorities, which include investing for profitable growth, M&A and share repurchases, where I'll turn next. During the nine months ended September 30, we repurchased 6 million shares for a total cost of approximately $33.6 million and through the close of trading yesterday we have repurchased a total of 6.6 million shares for a total cost of approximately $37.7 million in 2023. I would now like to turn to our financial outlook where for the full year we are pleased to once again raise our expectations for total ARR, total revenue and operating income. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenues of $70.5 million to $72.5 million or year-over-year growth of 12% at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP operating income of $8.1 million to $9.1 million representing an operating margin of 12% at the midpoint and year-over-year margin expansion of more than 1000 basis points. For the full year we now expect total ARR of $261 million to $263 million or year-over-year growth of 22% at the midpoint. We now expect total revenues of $267.7 million to $269.7 million or year-over-year growth of 16% at the midpoint. Lastly, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $20 million to $21 million. This represents an operating margin of 7.6% and year-over-year margin expansion of nearly 900 basis points. This also represents nearly 240 basis points of improvement relative to our initial 2023 operating margin guidance in March as we continue to drive operating leverage across our business. In summary, we are pleased with our Q3 results and we are equally excited for a strong close to 2023 as our commitment to profitable growth continues to drive shareholder value. Thanks for joining us today and with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi. Please proceed.
Fatima Boolani: Thank you. And thank you for taking my questions. TJ, I wanted to start with you with respect to Opus and really delve into your philosophy around commercialization. In other words, I want to get an understanding of is this going to be a discrete incremental monetization opportunity for you or is it going to be used as a strategic and competitive maneuver to drive better retention and expansion velocity in the base? I would love to unpack that with you in terms of monetization strategy. And then a follow up as well, please.
Tianyi Jiang: Thank you Fatima for that question. Yes, so last earnings we already discussed, we had preview customers with government agencies that's already deriving productivity improvements with this product. This is actually the new generation of our cloud archiving and record management product. So it's actually both. It's both of incremental revenue go getter for us as well as the expansion of emphasizing the platform play that we have around the whole end-to-end lifecycle management of business data. So that's part of it. It's also related to second part of your question.
GenAI Rush:
Fatima Boolani: Thank you for that. I just wanted to shift gears into your performance by geographic theaters. I mean, the United States performance stands out to me. It's growing at a fraction of the rate of your rest of world regions. And it's actually, based on what I see, has seen the most deceleration in the last several quarters. So I kind of wanted to understand why the disconnect in the North American markets versus your international execution?
James Caci: Great. Thanks, Fatima, for the question. So may be a couple of thoughts. Right? One is, we're seeing, as you mentioned, it's 8% growth in terms of revenue growth. But if we think about that, it's really a revenue mix issue that's driving that. And what we're seeing is in North America, we're seeing significant growth on the SaaS side. So we saw 28% growth year-over-year on SaaS. And then our term license revenue was actually down 10%. So it's a little bit of a mix. So the most important thing that we're looking at is really our ARR growth in North America. And what we see there is growth that's in line with the overall company growth that we reported for the quarter of 23%. So we're right in line with that. And so for us, we don't look at it as necessarily deterioration. We're just looking at really as a mix shift. And in the long run, I think that helps us.
Fatima Boolani: I appreciate that color. Thank you.
James Caci: Sure.
Operator: Your next question is from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.

GenAI:
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And you raised your operating income guidance again for the year. What's driving that operating leverage? Is that primarily associated with your shift to the channel or other factors that might go into this?
James Caci: Yes. Thanks, Max. I think it's really across the board, right. That is clearly a factor. I think we are getting leverage really across our sales and marketing teams as well as our general and admin expenses. You can see that really across the board. So I think the channel is playing a component. We're able to see some leverage there. But I also think we're able to take advantage of really leveraging some of our G&A expenses as well. So, I think we're looking to continue that really into Q4 and beyond. The focus this year has really been on profitable growth, and I think that comes from the channel is helping that in terms of leverage. But we're also examining all parts of the business and ensuring that we're as efficient and effective as possible.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Chirag Ved: Hi, this is Chirag Ved on for Kirk. Congratulations on the strong quarter, and thanks for taking the question. I first wanted to ask about the broader demand environment, whether anything has changed from the past quarter and how that compares across the customer segments you sell to whether enterprise mid-market and SMB. So any commentary on the general macro spending environment and customer budgets would be very useful. Thank you.
Tianyi Jiang: Yes, thanks for the question. So we're seeing, it's still a very challenging macro environment and pretty uncertain. We're still seeing the same scrutiny around budgets, so we see that continuing. We don't think it's gotten worse. When we think about the demand, we actually – I think last quarter we referred to it as stabilization, and I think I would continue to use that terminology when we look at our deal cycles and how long it's taking to get deals through the process, that doesn't seem to have changed much. This year is longer than the past, but it hasn't been getting worse as we've gone through the year. So I think that's kind of stabilized. And when we look at the three segments, our SMB segment is our fastest growing segment that continues to be, but all three segments have been healthy in terms of growth. So again, we're not really seeing any one particular segment overly affected. So again, we were really pleased with the quarter's performance, and it's really across all three segments.
Chirag Ved: All right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Nehal Chokshi: Great. Thank you. Great quarter, guys. Any specific skews driving the slight improvement to the net revenue retention rate?
James Caci: Yes, well, I think it's a couple of things. Right. In terms of we definitely have seen TJ pointed out a couple customer acceleration or additions in the quarter. I think those were very helpful. I think we're seeing customers really look to reduce costs. So we've seen some consolidation. We've seen some of our products that are helping them do that with existing customers. So I think that's really been the key call outs. I think we're still in this macro uncertain environment. Right. So we're pleased with the quarter's performance, but again, we're being very cautiously optimistic when we think about the rest of the year.
Nehal Chokshi: And if I may, for calendar 2023 ending, you're guiding to 22% ARR growth as is. What's the FX adjusted expectation with current rates?
James Caci: Well, again, for us, it's interesting, right. We've got a very global business. So we've seen this year, if you look at the FX impacts around the globe, we've seen EMEA kind of come back in terms of the euro against the dollar. That's gotten stronger, but we've seen the Japanese Yen continue to get weak against the dollar. And for us, those kind of offset each other slightly. So we're going to see slight improvement on the ARR in terms of this 22 probably gets us another two points in total for the year. I mean, you can see that as we were in Q3 2023 and 2025, I think it's probably similar for the year somewhere in that 1% to 2% impact of FX.
Nehal Chokshi: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Please proceed.
Derrick Wood: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question, TJ, we're hearing more and more that cloud optimization efforts are something here to stay with workload governance and cost management. A core part of your value proposition, just curious, is the level of the buyer that you're engaging changing at all? And how do you feel about positioning for larger budget capture? And I guess I'd ask the same thing for AI I mean as companies perhaps view you guys as critical in helping train models against private data, do you think that new buyers to engage with surface?
Tianyi Jiang: Hi Derrick. Great question. The first part of that is cloud Ops cost control really plays into our wheelhouse, our platform advantage, especially with control suite around operation management, entitlement management, and of course this whole lifecycle management, including low code, no code platforms, that's PowerApps is in high demand. So that part is really well. And with AI, I have so much conversation now with the CISOs and CIOs around, rolling out copilot to make sure that there's copilot readiness. So that means making sure that folks don't have over privileged access to suggestions from Copilot in terms of drafting answers and leveraging corporate data. So that's a very, very active area and topic. We actually see tremendous opportunity to expand our value-added strategic offer there. So that's why at my earlier comment, we think that that will drive a lot of the business growth in the coming quarters and years. So yes, both of those platform play, as well as the necessity around proper information management to drive a better outcome with AI is going to be the major theme going forward. And by the way, we're not a stranger to AI. We've been a longtime consumer of cognitive services on Azure, which is basically the front end to OpenAI for a number of years now. We have solutions that does these detection of ransomware attacks, for example, and auto classification taxonomy generation, as well as data analytics services using previous paradigms in AI, of course, now infusion of Gen AI architecture, so yes these are things are major themes that's going to carry forward in driving momentum for the business.
Derrick Wood: Got it, thanks there. And a follow up for Jim on the ARR guidance. If I look at what it implies for net new ARR, it's down quarter-over-quarter in the Q4, and I think the same thing happened last year. But could you just remind us why this is the case in a Q4? Does it have something to do with spiking government strength in Q3, or what are the dynamics that have net new ARR going down sequentially?
James Caci: Yes, good question, Derrick. So yes, part of that is what you just said. That's definitely part of it. I think the second half of that really deals more with the macro environment we see. When we came into Q3, we kind of set the expectation that we'd be somewhere between $24 million and $25 million of incremental ARR in the second half of the year. And so we still feel really good about that. And obviously we're pleased with how we performed in Q3. I think some of it is a little bit of the government sector, the public sector. But again, we're just thinking about the macro environment, the uncertainties, and again, still feel very comfortable with that original set of getting somewhere between 2024 and 2025. We have a small raise for ARR for Q4, and we feel comfortable about that in light of the macro environment right now.
Derrick Wood: Thank you.
James Caci: Thanks, Derrick.
Operator: The next question is from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please proceed.
Jason Ader: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Just wanted to ask you, on first off on the revenue growth guidance for Q4 12% that would be quite a bit lower than where it was in the first three quarters of the year and certainly lower than where it's been historically. Is there something unique going on in Q4? Is it just Macro? Maybe just help us square why the revenue growth would decelerate as much as that.
Tianyi Jiang: Sure. Thanks, Jason. So maybe it's two factors, right? One is what you called out in terms of the macro environment. Again, just trying to plan for uncertainties. And then the second piece might be that in Q3, even though our term license revenue is down 10% year-over-year, it is higher than what our expectation was coming into, really the second half of the year. And so, in essence, right that term license revenue is going to pull a little revenue out of future periods and have it land in Q3, which helped a little bit with the beat we saw in Q3, but it also then negatively impacts Q4. So again, I think it's more the macro, but we're trying to take those factors into play.
Jason Ader: Understood. Okay, great. And then on the gross revenue retention, you're in the mid 80s right now. You're primarily an enterprise focused company that's definitely on the low end of companies that sell into the enterprise. Can you help us understand why your gross revenue retention isn't higher? I know you have aspirations to get it to 90% plus. What needs to happen for you to get to that 90% plus? And then also, when somebody does churn off, like what's the main reason somebody's churning off?
James Caci: Yes, good question, Jason. And you're right. Our focus has been that our long term goal here is to be 90 plus in terms of our gross retention rate. That's our stated focus. We've got multiple initiatives working on that from everything from customer engagement, all kinds of different retention scenarios around that, including some of the things that we're talking about here with AI and really looking at behavior of customers, all the way through their lifecycle with us as a customer. So I do think we have a lot of things that are in place that we're working on that are going to reap rewards and improvement for that. I do think this year in particular, we've talked about this uncertainty, and I think we are seeing it show up in terms of some of our activities. And keep in mind that most of our licensing is seat based or employee driven. And so we are seeing that impact a little bit this year as well. And so I think when you factor in the macro and our kind of licensing base today, I think we're pleased right now that we're in that 87% range right now in terms of growth retention. But again, we are initiating a bunch of things that we anticipate over time will definitely improve that gross retention.
Jason Ader: All right, thank you.
Tianyi Jiang: Jason, I would just say that.
Jason Ader: Yes, go ahead, TJ.
Tianyi Jiang: Yes, Jason, I would just say that in 2020, our gross retention is 83%. So we're sitting at 87% now. It's a market improvement. Also, enterprise is about half of our business now, with mid-market being 30% and SMB being 20%. So given that mix, we're actually decently happy with the current mixture. Of course, we'll continue to work to improve that, but we do have quite a sizable non enterprise business now.
Jason Ader: Would you say the gross revenue retention for the 50% that's enterprise is north of 90? Would that be fair?
Tianyi Jiang: It is definitely higher, as you would expect the tiers are the way you would expect. Our enterprise group has the highest retention. Mid-market is slightly lower, and then SMB is the lowest. So, yes, you're directionally absolutely correct.
Jason Ader: All right, thanks, guys. Good luck.
Tianyi Jiang: Thanks, Jason.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. TJ Jiang for any closing remarks.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Vice President, Investor Relations, Michaella Gallina. Please go ahead.
Michaella Gallina: Thank you, Latif. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to H&R Block's first quarter fiscal year 2024 financial results conference call.

Jeff Jones: Thank you, Michaella. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I will begin with a summary of our Q1 results and provide an update on our Block Horizons strategic imperatives. Then Tony will discuss our financials, including the strength of our capital allocation and balance sheet. While we are early in the year and Q1 is a relatively small portion of our results, we had a good start and are reaffirming our fiscal '24 outlook. We were pleased given that we lapped a very strong extended season last year and our share in both DIY and Assisted slightly improved throughout the year. With favorability in NAC, we grew revenue, continued to manage our expenses well and demonstrated ongoing progress on our Block Horizons strategy, which I'll share more about in a moment. We also continued our share repurchase program, buying $132 million in the quarter. Let's go deeper into Block Horizons, beginning with small business, which includes small business tax and services and Wave. Assisted small business total revenue growth was 6% in the quarter, and we're pleased with the early signals we are seeing in bookkeeping and payroll services which are growing double digits. We see a long runway of opportunity and are focused on continuing our momentum, which includes growing clients in both tax and services and driving business formations, which we launched last year. Overall, we feel good about the trajectory of small business. Turning to Wave. Revenue growth was 6% in Q1, which was in line with our expectations. As we've shared, we underwent a strategic review of the business when the new leader was put in place. We now have a plan to accelerate revenue growth and put us on a path to profitability. Before I share those plans, I want to recap Wave's current business model, which provides tremendous value for small business owners by offering free invoicing and accounting. Wave has monetized its platform primarily through payment processing as well as payroll and advisory services. We are now beginning a strategic shift to solve customer pain points that will deliver value and monetize more premium features. In the payment space, customers are wanting additional options beyond credit cards which Wave historically has not provided. Today, less than 30% of invoices sent by small businesses through Wave's platform are enabled for credit card or bank payments. Thus, there's a significant opportunity to unlock value as we enable our customers to be paid via alternative methods and expand our share of wallet. We also see an opportunity to build other premium features that help our customers run their small business. Last quarter, we launched the mobile receipts feature, which is a monthly or annual subscription that generates additional recurring revenue. This product's uptake has been better than expected and is a good example of where we're heading. I am excited about the shifts we're making and the opportunities we see in this business. Now I'll move on to financial products. Regarding Spruce, recall that tax season '23 was the first time the product was introduced in the Assisted channel. Our learnings have informed our actions for the next tax season, and we are continuing to drive innovation for the customer experience. We've made the account creation and sign-up process more seamless in all our channels and deposit trends from customers utilizing Spruce to receive their payroll direct deposit continue to improve. As of September 30, we surpassed 300,000 sign-ups and had almost $400 million in customer deposits. In fiscal '24, we are focused on efficiently acquiring clients at tax time, which includes the DIY flow and driving customer engagement within the app. Now let's turn to Block experience. This imperative is all about blending digital tools with human health to provide better experiences for clients while empowering them to be served; however, they choose, fully virtual to fully in-person and everything in between. We have made a number of enhancements to MyBlock this year. Within the app, clients will now have visibility of where they are at each stage of the tax prep process through a status tracker on their home page. In addition, we'll be delivering a personalized checklist to help clients be better prepared for forms they will need and how to upload them ahead of time. The app will provide help at each stage with a call to action that recommends clients' next step, whether uploading new documents getting help from one of our expert tax professionals or notifying them that is time to review their return which was made easier and faster to approve and sign online. Clients also have the ability to access their tax documents and return digitally which aligns with our new print-less strategy to reduce paper consumption in our offices. This is a benefit for our clients results in cost savings and is one of the many ways we live our commitment to environmental sustainability. Another priority within Block experience is leaning into GenAI. As we've shared, we are initially focused on two areas: first, enhancing the customer experience; and second, reducing expenses and increasing productivity. In the DIY channel, we're working on exciting innovations that will support our clients throughout the tax prep experience, and we are testing the ability to use AI to field customer calls. Over time, we believe these initiatives can result in meaningful cost savings but we are not assuming any this fiscal year as we are in initial testing phases. All in all, we're making tangible progress through our partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). In fact, they recently highlighted our work to thought leaders and industry experts during the Envision tour in New York. As you can see, our team continues to make progress, and we are well-positioned to deliver results this year. Before turning it to Tony, I want to mention that we recently published our fourth annual environmental, social and governance report for fiscal year '23, reflecting our ongoing commitment to transparency, sustainability and responsible business practices. I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website to read it in full. With that, I will now pass things over to Tony to share more about our financial results.
Tony Bowen: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q1, we delivered $183.8 million of revenue, an increase of 2% or $3.8 million over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher U.S.-assisted tax preparation revenues driven by an increase in net average charge, partially offset by lower Emerald Card revenues. Total operating expenses were approximately $390 million, an increase of about 30 basis points or $1 million. Corporate wages and bad debt were higher and marketing and advertising as well as consulting expenses were lower than last year. EBITDA was a loss of approximately $166 million, an improvement of 3% or $6 million from the prior year. Interest expense was about $16 million, which is essentially unchanged to last year. Pretax loss decreased by $9 million to $212.4 million, primarily due to higher revenues and interest income in the current year. Our effective tax rate was 23.3% compared to 24.4% last year. Loss per share from continuing operations was $1.11 compared to $1.05 last year, while adjusted loss per share from continuing operations was $1.05 compared to $0.99 last year due to fewer shares outstanding. As a reminder, in quarters with the loss, fewer shares outstanding increase loss per share but is accretive as we generate earnings for the full year. As Jeff shared, we had a good start to the year and are reaffirming our full year 2024 outlook and longer-term total shareholder return algorithm that calls for topline growth, EBITDA that outpaces revenue and EPS, it grows even faster. Turning to Capital Allocation. Our practice remains robust. In Q1, we repurchased a total of 3.3 million shares for $132 million at an average price of $40.43. This retired another 2% of our float. Since 2016, we have reduced shares outstanding by over 38%. Additionally, last week, the Board of Directors declared our quarterly cash dividend. Since 2016, we have grown the dividend 60%, yet the total dollars paid out continue to decrease because of how quickly we are buying back shares. Given the macro environment and the expectation of high interest rates for the foreseeable future, I'd also like to share more about the strength of our balance sheet. We continue to feel great about our relatively low leverage with $1.5 billion of long-term debt against our over $900 million of EBITDA in the most recent year. Our next debt maturity of $350 million isn't until October of 2025, which is our smallest tranche and we don't have another tranche maturing after that until 2028. As we've shared before, as interest rates rise, it benefits our P&L on a short-term basis, as our interest income from our cash position will exceed our short-term recurring interest expense for the full year. Overall, we feel very good about our balance sheet and how we are positioned in the current environment. In summary, our financial story is positive. We drive topline growth, EBITDA that outpaces revenue and EPS that grows even faster. We have strong capital allocation practices to reliably return value to shareholders, and our balance sheet positions us well for the macro trends. With that, I will now hand it back over to Jeff for some closing remarks.
Jeff Jones: Thanks, Tony. I'm looking forward to all that we will accomplish this year. In closing, I'd like to extend a sincere thank you to our associates, franchisees and tax professionals for all they do year-round to deliver on our purpose of providing help and inspiring confidence in our clients and communities everywhere. Now operator, we will open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.
Kartik Mehta: Jeff, just your thoughts on marketing as we go into next tax season, I know last tax season, you're focused on DIY at least from the marketing eyes on. I'm wondering, as we go into this tax season, do you follow the same strategy, or does that change?
Jeff Jones: Yes, Kartik. So there's a few things I would share. I mean the first is remembering that we're very audience driven in our approach to marketing. So it's very likely you don't see everything that we're doing for a particular audience. So that's number one. We obviously have several different jobs to do. We had a winning formula in DIY last year. We want to do all we can to replicate that kind of performance. We also know when we evaluated our client loss in Assisted, we broke that down into the three buckets at the end of the year, really winning with the EITC client is the top of the priority list. And so that means several different things for marketing this year. It means a strong reevaluation of the message how we think about refund advance, the media channels we use and the timing of those messages. So all those things have been reevaluated as we prepare for the upcoming season.
Kartik Mehta: And Jeff, just as a follow-on, I know you've said in the last tax season that you wanted to win with the EITC, the tax season. Does that require you to make changes to the refund transfer product, make the amount available bigger, or any other changes you feel you need to compete better?
Jeff Jones: Yes, it's a great question and one I signaled on the last call, we know that last year, we didn't do a good enough job of being in the market with the refund advance message at the right time. And that's really the starting point for how we communicate the value proposition to the customer. We've done even more research with that audience since last year to understand pricing and other matters that we continue to feel good about. We looked at and decided not to participate in the refund advance business where people are promising a much higher rate, but coming with fees and interest. And so we've eliminated that as something that we think is the right business to be in for us. So it's really about that message earlier in the season communicating our total value proposition.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer & Company.
Scott Schneeberger: Can you hear me?
Jeff Jones: Yes, Scott, we got you.
Scott Schneeberger: Good. Yes, I just ask something on the quarter to get us started. The mild outperformance in revenue, nice to see, and it wasn't a grand magnitude. I was just curious if the -- if the later California filings from last fiscal year had any impact. It looks like it's not going to affect this back half of the year very much as some had wondered. And so just a comment on that. And then also on just the current quarter, the operating expense increase was relatively modest in the inflationary environment. So it looks like you did a nice job of managing wages, marketing advertising and then per Kartik's question, obviously, that's going to be heavier later in the year, but you also cited consulting. So just the second part of the question is just kind of curious how you manage expenses in the quarter? And what should we expect prior to tax season and then in tax season to keep up the good momentum there?
Jeff Jones: Yes. So I'll pick the revenue piece and Tony can comment on OpEx. But yes, so first of all, I'd say remembering, we lapped a strong extension season last year. And in light of that, we feel good about our volume performance against our expectations. As we mentioned, we saw some slight share gain in both the assisted and DIY business in this first quarter. And then we saw a continuation of the price increases we took last year and some favorable mix, which helped drive revenue. And then when we saw the extension happen in California, obviously, we talked about keeping more offices open, more tax pros staffed. And we think we did a nice job of winning our fair share in California leading up to October 15. So when you put all those things together, it is a relatively small part of the business, as we always say, but we feel good about the start to the year.
Tony Bowen: Yes. And on the expense side, we are happy with the very modest increase we saw in Q1. We're continuing to see inflationary pressure. So it's not that it's completely dissipated. Obviously, we did an annual merit cycle this summer that's flowing in the P&L in Q1. We're continuing to see rent prices go up as well as utilities. But we're doing what we can to offset that. You mentioned a few things and marketing be a little bit lower consulting expenses being a little bit lower in Q1. So we're reaffirming our full year guidance. We think we're off to a good start. Expense management is obviously a key focus for us, and we think that will continue in Q2.
Scott Schneeberger: Right. And as a follow-up, I think I'll just kind of ask industry level. What are you seeing here in with regard to the IRS and its pilot program associated with being a tax preparation organization itself? And then also just mathematically, to 99k, any developments there that you're hearing? And could that be something that is a new and different angle for this year?
Jeff Jones: Yes. I'll pick up 10.99 first, actually. We believe it will be in place. There is a possibility as always some year-end legislation could change that like it happened last year. It's not contemplated in our outlook book, but we do have some real thoughtful plans in place should it proceed that we're ready to capture that opportunity when the season kicks off. So that's on 10.99K and with respect to the IRS, even in their latest briefing, Scott, they really dialed back the size and magnitude of what they think they'll pilot this year. We expect that to be much smaller than they originally had planned. But if we just take a step back from that, we know the consumers spoken loud and clear. They don't think the IRS should be in the business. We've been very clear on our position about that. There are over 30 organizations, including us that already offer free tax preparation. So our view on it really hasn't changed. It does sound like their plans have changed. And I just -- we find it hard to believe over time that they'll be able to use taxpayer dollars to be in the business of building a product, marketing a product and supporting a product year in and year out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: As you think about your strategy with EITC tax filers, in the prior tax season, marketing, the value proposition of Refund Advance, for example, is definitely an important part, but also a decrease in the average refund size and an increase in balance due returns had an impact on that demographic. Can you talk about how those other factors, which HR has less control over might materialize over the upcoming tax season?
Jeff Jones: Yes, George, thank you for that question. I mean, obviously, those are things that are out of our control, except to the degree we can educate and communicate to clients, and that's really where we focus in what we call this off-season of how we deploy training to tax professionals to help them understand in that moment of truth if someone's outcome has changed why that is and what they can do about it for the next year. So we definitely have taken those steps to get ready for this tax season in addition to the marketing comments that I made earlier with Kartik's question.
Tony Bowen: Yes. The one thing I would add, George, is last year we saw a pretty big change in, as you said, the amount of refunds and who's getting refunds. And we've essentially believe we've got a new baseline going into this year. So we aren't expecting another drop in the amount of refunds. There's no major tax solid changes that would drive that. So I think customers kind of understand now kind of what to expect based on last year's results. And to Jeff's point, the EITC customers while the refund maybe went down a little bit, they're all still getting refunds, obviously. And it's just really about the education side that's really important.
George Tong: Great. Got it. That's helpful. And then can you provide your latest thoughts on your pricing strategy with normalization of inflation trends, and how pricing and Assisted in DIY would evolve heading into next year?
Jeff Jones: Absolutely. And as you asked, we kind of split it into two parts. On the assisted side, we believe that we're able to take low single-digit price increases, which is what's contemplated in our plan for this year. As you've heard me say many times, every year, we reevaluate that based on customer satisfaction and value for price paid metrics. So we feel good about that continued movement, which we'll do this year. In the DIY business, obviously, it's more dynamic. There are more factors to consider between core SKUs, early season, late season and attached products. In general, we still see opportunity to maintain a price advantage into it, and we'll do that again this year and actively market against what we believe our advantage is and how easy it is to switch to H&R Block.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Paris of Barrington Research. Your line is open Alex. And alex, please make sure your line is unmuted and if you are on a speaker phone, lift your handset. And I'm at pause just to see if he queues back up. And he has not. I would now like to turn the conference back to Michaella Gallina for closing remarks. Madam?
Michaella Gallina: Thank you, Latif, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our first quarter 2024 financial results conference call.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/openais-board-approached-anthropic-ceo-about-top-job-and-merger--sources-3239625,"Nov 20, 2023","By Jeffrey Dastin (Reuters) - OpenAI's board of directors approached rival Anthropic's CEO about replacing chief Sam Altman and potentially merging the two AI startups, according to two people briefed on the matter. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei declined on both fronts, the people said. The news, reported earlier by The Information on Monday, follows various reported calls to find Altman's successor days after OpenAI's board ousted him. OpenAI declined to comment and board member Adam D'Angelo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Sunday the board offered ex-Twitch CEO Emmett Shear to be its interim chief, who accepted. Meanwhile, Altman agreed to join the startup's backer Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with other key personnel from OpenAI. By Monday, nearly all of the startup's more than 700 employees threatened to quit, including one of its executives on OpenAI's now four-person board. 
The co-founders of Anthropic, who were also executives at OpenAI until 2020, had broken from their employer over disagreements regarding how to ensure AI's safe development and governance. Anthropic has won investments from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Its Claude AI models have vied for prominence with OpenAI's GPT series.",0.7717

The event was marked by the introduction of the latest version of its ChatGPT models, the GPT-4 Turbo. This advanced model leverages data up to April 2023 and supports image generation through DALL-E 3, while being three times more cost-effective than its predecessors.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that the Turbo model is currently under testing by select users and is expected to be released to the public soon. Alongside this, OpenAI also announced plans for a GPT store that allows individuals to create and upload their personalized chatbots without needing any coding expertise. Creators will earn revenue based on downloads of their chatbots.
The company is also committed to protecting users from copyright infringement lawsuits associated with the model’s use. It has launched a copyright shield to tackle these issues and has pledged to cover any legal expenses involved.
In addition to these developments, OpenAI introduced revenue-sharing agreements for top app developers and customization options for ChatGPT. The company, which boasts an extensive network of 2 million developers and over 100 million weekly active users, aims to streamline GenAI integration across platforms with its new GPTs.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made an unexpected appearance at the event, underscoring their partnership with OpenAI. He discussed infrastructure expansion and cutting-edge models that can enhance Microsoft's AI offerings. Microsoft's significant investment earlier this year led to a 49% stake in OpenAI.
These strategic alliances could potentially increase Azure usage, thereby benefiting Microsoft, according to Citi analysts. These developments have led TipRanks to forecast a potential 14.7% upside for Microsoft's stock, holding a price target of $408.83.
OpenAI's partnerships with 92% of Fortune 500 companies and its robust user base position it as a significant player in the AI industry. The company also showcased a new text-to-speech model (TTS) and image inputs for GPT-4 Turbo for caption generation and analysis, further expanding its AI capabilities.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/openai-to-make-models-cheaper-more-powerful-in-its-first-developer-conference-3221981,"Nov 03, 2023","By Anna Tong and Krystal Hu ChatGPT maker OpenAI is expected to announce product enhancements that will make its AI models cheaper, with more functionality, in its first-ever developer conference on Monday. The conference signals OpenAI's ambition to expand beyond a consumer sensation to becoming a provider of a hit developer platform, and CEO Sam Altman has teased attendees with the promise of ""some great new stuff."" The one-day event, in a desolate area of San Francisco near City Hall, is attracting hundreds of developers from around the world. The burgeoning AI sector has been a bright spot for San Francisco's economy, which has struggled to bounce back from the pandemic. After toiling in relative obscurity for years, OpenAI kicked off the generative AI craze last November by releasing ChatGPT, the darling chatbot of Silicon Valley that became one of the world's fastest growing consumer applications. Generative AI can, using past data, create brand new content like fully formed text, images and software code. Backed by billions of dollars from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), OpenAI has become for many the default version of generative AI, helping users spin up term papers, contracts, travel itineraries and even entire novels. OpenAI is expected to announce updates focused on slashing costs for its developers, as well as new vision capabilities, Reuters previously reported. Cost-cutting addresses a major concern for partners whose spending on OpenAI's powerful models could pile up quickly as they try to build sustainable businesses by developing and selling AI software. The vision capabilities, which will enable OpenAI's software to analyze images and describe them, will enable developers to build applications with new uses in fields from entertainment to medicine. 
Another announcement could be an ability to fine-tune GPT-4, its most advanced AI model, which the company previously said would be coming in the fall. These updates are designed to encourage companies to use OpenAI's technology to build AI-powered chatbots and autonomous agents that can perform tasks without human intervention. Making OpenAI indispensable to other companies building apps is among the most important strategic objectives for Altman, sources familiar with his thinking said.",0.9899

There will also be important testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who appears Tuesday and Wednesday before congressional panels on the economy and monetary policy.
Several important economic reports also expected, with retail sales on Monday topping the list.
Elsewhere, in Asia, China is slated to release what will be closely watched second-quarter growth data, amid warnings from analysts that the recent trade dispute with the U.S. could drag on economic activity.
Market focus is also largely attuned to the next potential steps of the U.S.-China trade conflict. The U.S. threatened 10% tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports last week. However, a lack of response from China to these levies so far has assuaged some fears of conflict escalation.
Trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions between the world's two largest economies having an impact on economic growth.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. Trump-Putin Summit 
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin hold their first summit in Helsinki, Finland on Monday.
Neither side expects the one-day summit to yield major policy breakthroughs given the battered state of U.S.-Russia relations, which are languishing at their lowest ebb since the Cold War.
Geopolitical analysts expect Putin to urge Trump to soften sanctions imposed over Ukraine, while Trump has said he will press Putin on everything from allegations of meddling in the 2016 U.S. election to the war in Syria.
On Friday, some lawmakers pressed Trump to cancel the summit after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russians for interfering in the general election.
Meanwhile, European leaders will be watching the outcome closely, especially after Trump called Germany a ""captive"" of Russia at a testy NATO summit in Belgium last week, due to its plans for a major new gas pipeline.
2. U.S. Q2 Earnings Season Kicks Into High Gear
There are about 60 S&P 500 companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, including seven Dow stocks, in what will be the first big week of the second-quarter earnings season.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) report Monday, along with tech darling Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Tuesday sees Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) post results.
On Wednesday,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) report earnings.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are on the docket Thursday.
Finally, corporate results from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) round up the week on Friday.



Analysts have said they are expecting another strong quarter, with earnings growth at around 21%, according to Thomson Reuters data. However, the season is being clouded by trade tensions and their impact on corporate profits, with analysts likely to scrutinize outlook statements to see if companies discuss the impact of Trump's trade policies on future spending plans, input costs and profitability.
3. Fed Chair Powell Testifies
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver his semi-annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC.
Powell is scheduled to testify on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00AM ET Tuesday. On Wednesday, he will appear in front the House Financial Services Committee also at 10AM ET.
Text of the testimony will be released 90 minutes before he starts speaking.
Powell's comments will be monitored closely for further clues on when and how fast the Fed will raise interest rates.
The Fed's semi-annual report on monetary policy, sent to Congress last Friday, pointed to ""solid"" U.S. economic growth and reiterated its plans to continue raising interest rates gradually.
4. U.S. Retail Sales
The Commerce Department will publish data on retail sales for June at 8:30AM ET Monday.
The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0.4% last month, moderating from a gain of 0.8% in May.
Excluding the automobile sector, sales are expected to increase 0.4%, after a 0.9% rise a month earlier.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.
Besides the retail sales report, this week's calendar also features U.S. data on building permits, housing starts, industrial production, as well as surveys on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia and New York regions.
On the central bank front, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book will be in focus.
The U.S. central bank hiked interest rates last month for the second time this year and has projected two more rate increases by year-end.
Traders are currently pricing in around an 85% chance of a rate hike in September, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a fourth rate hike by December was seen at about 55%.
5. China Q2 GDP
China will be the first major economy to report second-quarter growth data when it publishes its GDP numbers at around 0200GMT on Monday (10:00PM ET Sunday).
The report is expected to show the world's second-largest economy grew 6.7% in the April-June period, moderating slightly from growth of 6.8% in the first quarter.
The Asian nation will also publish data on June industrial production, fixed asset investment and retail sales along with the GDP report.
China, the world's largest exporter, has so far escaped any major blow to its foreign trade sector despite rising trade tensions with the U.S.
Washington and Beijing appeared increasingly headed toward open trade conflict after several rounds of negotiations failed to resolve U.S. complaints over Chinese industrial policies, lack of market access in China and a $375 billion U.S. trade deficit.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-thursday-1756153,"Jan 24, 2019","Investing.com -- Here are the top five things that you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, January 24:
1. Wall Street Set to Open Higher
Wall Street is set to open slightly higher, following another batch of generally reassuring earnings reports that also drove global stocks broadly higher overnight. Beats from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Wednesday suggested a broad swath of the economy remains in good health.
At 05:35 AM ET (10:35 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures were up 30 points, or about 0.10%, the S&P 500 futures rose 4 points, or around 0.16%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures was indicated up 29 points, or 0.44%.
Elsewhere, European stocks were mostly higher, with the tech sector rising sharply after a strong update from chipmaker STMicro. Earlier, markets in Asia  closed mostly higher, following Wall Street’s lead.
2. Senate Votes on Shutdown After Pelosi Bars Trump from House
The Senate will vote later Thursday on rival proposals to end the partial shutdown of the federal government.
The vote comes a day after President Donald Trump said he would put off holding his State of the Union address until the shutdown is over.
About a quarter of the government has been shut down since Dec. 22 when some U.S. agencies’ funding expired for reasons unrelated to border security or immigration. Trump has demanded that any shutdown-ending measure must contain $5.7 billion for building a wall on the U.S.’s southern border, funding that Democrats oppose.
3. Draghi to Be Watched for Signs of ECB Rate Hike Delay
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will hold a press conference after the ECB’s first policy-making meeting of the year, which comes after a worrying slowdown in the euro-zone economy in recent months.
Flash estimates released earlier Thursday showed Germany’s manufacturing sector contracted in January, while the euro-zone Purchasing Managers Index just stayed above the 50 level that signals expansion.
No change to policy is expected, but the market is looking for signs that the ECB’s first rate hike since 2009 - currently expected towards the end of this year - will be pushed back even further. The euro was down 0.30% against the dollar at $1.1346.
4. Jobless Claims, PMI Due
Data on initial jobless claims are due at 08:30 AM ET, with the number of those claiming expected to tick up slightly to 219,000 from 213,000 last week. Markit’s U.S. PMI for January is also due and is expected to show a slight drop to 53.5 from 53.8 in December.
Finally, the Kansas City Fed’s composite and manufacturing  indexes will be released at 16:00 PM ET.
While the figures remain broadly positive, crunch trade talks between the U.S. and China next week continue to overshadow them. Trade tensions ratcheted up again overnight as Beijing blocked access to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing search engine in China.
5. Oil Recovers From Surprise Surge in U.S. Crude Stocks
The more positive tone in equity markets overnight has supported U.S. crude after it fell on the back of data from the American Petroleum Institute Wednesday showing a surprise 6.5 million barrel rise in U.S. stocks last week.
The Energy Information Administration will release its weekly data dump at 11:00 AM ET (16:00 GMT).
The data come against the backdrop of upheaval in Venezuela, one of the biggest exporters of crude to U.S. refineries. The U.S. and other countries recognized Juan Gaido, head of the national assembly, as the legitimate President Wednesday, bolstering his attempt to overthrow Nicolas Maduro, whose victory in elections last year was overshadowed by claims of vote-rigging.
The turmoil has hit the stocks of refiners  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) and PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) in premarket trade.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was down 8.8% in premarket trading, after CEO Tim Cook said the company expects sales of $84 billion in the last quarter, down from earlier estimates of $89 billion to $93 billion.
“It's clear that the economy began to slow there for the second half and what I believe to be the case is the trade tensions between the United States and China put additional pressure on their economy,” Cook said in an interview with CNBC.

Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) lost 2% while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) slipped 2.6% and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down 2.3%.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell more than 9% after CEO Tim Cook said in a letter late Wednesday the company expects sales of $84 billion for the last quarter, down from earlier estimates of $89 billion to $93 billion. The lowered guidance is due to a steep decline in Chinese sales, as trade tensions have put pressure on China’s economy.
The news put a shadow over upcoming earnings results later in the month.
""This provides solid evidence of how slowing economic growth and a trade war make the best death cocktail for sentiment,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK.
Slowing growth in the manufacturing sector in the U.S. also rattled markets, as investors worry over slowing economic growth. The ISM manufacturing PMI index fell to 54.1 in December, compared to forecasts for a reading of 57.7.
Chipmakers were down, with Micron (NASDAQ:MU) slipping 5% and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) down 7.5%.  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) was off 1.7%.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-friday-1418199,"Apr 27, 2018","Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, April 27:
1. U.S. advanced first quarter GDP in focus
Investors will keep an eye on a preliminary reading of first-quarter U.S. growth due at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT) Friday to gauge if the world's largest economy is strong enough to withstand multiple rate hikes in the coming months.
The report is expected to show growth in the January-March period slowing from an annual rate of 2.9% to 2.0%, as consumer spending is forecast to have slowed sharply from the last quarter.
Despite the expected slowdown, the data is unlikely to make much impact on Fed policymakers given the expected boost over the coming months from the Trump administration tax cuts.
However, central banks are closely watching growth figures for signs of a global slowdown. The U.S. data will arrive after the UK registered its slowest growth in five years earlier on Friday, while the French economy also slowed more than expected to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2016.
Besides the GDP report, the University of Michigan will publish its revision of consumer sentiment for April at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT). A slight uptick to 98.0 from the initial reading of 97.8 is the consensus forecast.
2. Amazon and Microsoft expected to support tech stocks
Shares of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rallied nearly 7% to in pre-market trade on Friday, after the e-commerce giant posted earnings that beat on both the top and bottom line.
Amazon reported earnings of $3.27 per share on $51.04 billion in revenue, which was well above analysts’ expectations for earnings of $1.26 per share on $49.78 billion in revenue.
Amazon Web Services, the cloud service platform, continued to show robust growth, as revenue rose 49% to $5.44 billion, topping expectations of $5.25 billion.
Shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also gained nearly 2% in pre-market trade on Friday after topping consensus expectations.
Microsoft reported earnings of 95 cents per share on $26.82 billion in revenue, beating analysts’ expectations for earnings of 85 cents per share on $25.77 billion in revenue.
Microsoft’s personal computing segment posted revenue of $9.92 billion for the quarter, above analysts’ estimates of $9.25 billion.
Meanwhile, Microsoft’s transition from its legacy businesses to cloud remained on track as its Intelligent Cloud segment posted revenues of $7.90 billion beating Wall Street estimates of $7.68 billion.
Also on watch Friday, oil giants Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) will release quarterly earnings before the opening bell.
3. U.S. stocks point to mixed open ahead of GDP
After solid gains a day earlier, U.S. futures pointed to a more cautious stance on Friday ahead of first quarter GDP data. While both the Dow and S&P 500 looked set to register slight losses, tech stocks were holding onto slight gains as Amazon and Microsoft supported sentiment. At 5:36AM ET (9:36GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures fell 114 points, or 0.47%, S&P 500 futures lost 8 points, or 0.30%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures inched up 3 points, or 0.04%.
Elsewhere, European stocks headed for a fifth straight week of gains as well-received earnings from Spanish banks and a recovery in tech shares buoyed sentiment.
Earlier, Asian stocks closed higher as investors celebrated a rebound in tech stocks while markets in Seoul were underpinned by optimism as leaders of North and South Korea held their first summit in over a decade.
4. Oils cautious ahead of U.S. shale production data
The weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday at 1:00PM ET (17:00GMT) will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs rose for the third straight week.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Market participants remain concerned that rising U.S. output could potentially derail OPEC's effort to end a supply glut.
Domestic oil production - driven by shale extraction - rose to an all-time high of 10.52 million bpd last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, staying above Saudi Arabia's output levels and within reach of Russia, the world's biggest crude producer.
OPEC and other producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in November last year to slash global inventories to the five year-average. The arrangement is set to expire at the end of 2018 although traders hold hopes that it could be extended into next year when OPEC gathers for its meeting in June.
U.S. crude oil futures fell 0.45% to $67.88 at 5:38AM ET (9:38GMT), while Brent oil traded down 0.45% to $74.40.
5. BoJ stands pat amid central bank immobility
The Bank of Japan left its monetary stimulus program unchanged on Friday, as expected, but removed previous wording on reaching its 2% inflation around fiscal 2019, underscoring just how much more time will be needed to reach its 2% target. Its overall inflation forecasts were largely unchanged.
The move came after the European Central Bank also held steady on Thursday with ECB president Mario Draghi refraining from discussing the end of asset purchases or even the stronger euro as they focused on gauging the health of the region’s economy. Momentum has waned since the start of the year, and any pickup in underlying inflation appears to have stalled.
Although the Federal Reserve has led the central banker pack with six interest rate increases since 2015, global policymakers are in a wait-and-see mode as they look for signs of a slowdown in global growth. The Fed is expected to hold steady at its meeting next week, though markets are pricing in the next rate hike for June and odds for an additional two posterior increases by the end of the year were hovering just below the 50% threshold.",0.9909

Gains in the Nasdaq were expected on Friday after stellar results were reported after the prior day’s close.
Shares of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rallied around 7% to in pre-market trade on Friday, after the e-commerce giant posted earnings that beat on both the top and bottom line.
Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also gained nearly 4% in pre-market trade on Friday after the computer giant also topped consensus expectations.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also delivered and saw shares jump more than 5% pre-market after reporting the biggest-ever quarterly jump in its data center business.
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) will be among other firms releasing quarterly earnings before Friday’s opening bell.
With nearly 50% of S&P 500 firms having released their reports, more than 70% of those have beat on both the top and bottom line and the first quarter is showing the best rates of growth in sales and profit in any quarter since 2010.
On the economic front, investors looked ahead to the preliminary reading of first-quarter U.S. growth due at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT) Friday to gauge if the world's largest economy is strong enough to withstand multiple rate hikes in the coming months.
The report is expected to show growth in the January-March period slowing from an annual rate of 2.9% to 2.0%, as consumer spending is forecast to have slowed sharply from the last quarter.

The U.S. data will arrive after the UK registered its slowest growth in five years earlier on Friday, while the French economy also slowed more than expected to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2016.
Markets are largely expecting the Federal Reserve to stand pat on policy when it meets next week. The lack of changes would follow similar decisions by both the Bank of Japan earlier on Friday and the European Central Bank on Thursday.
In other data to be released stateside on Friday, the University of Michigan will publish its revision of consumer sentiment for April at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT). A slight uptick to 98.0 from the initial reading of 97.8 is the consensus forecast.
While waiting for the economic data, the dollar extended gains against major rivals and, on track for a weekly rise of around 1.7%, was celebrating its best week since November 2016.
On the geopolitical front, American traders will rise on Friday to the news of a historic peace agreement between North and South Korea. In a joint declaration, both leaders confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and declared that “there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and thus a new era of peace has begun”.
Elsewhere, European stocks headed for a fifth straight week of gains as well-received earnings from Spanish banks and a recovery in tech shares buoyed sentiment.
Earlier, Asian stocks closed higher as investors celebrated a rebound in tech stocks while markets in Seoul were underpinned by optimism as leaders of North and South Korea held their first summit in over a decade.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.03%. The S&P 500 fell 0.09%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.07%.
U.S.-China trade war tensions returned to the fold after President Donald Trump said he was ""ready"" to slap $500 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods imported to the United States.
Fears over an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China were exacerbated as Trump took to Twitter, criticizing China, and other countries for ""manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower.""
Trump's rebuke of China came as the Far-East nation lowered its overnight its 7-day Treasury rate by 103 basis points, pushing the yuan to its lowest level in a year. Some cited the move as a countermeasure against U.S. tariffs.
That dampened the upbeat start to the session, which followed quarterly earnings results from Microsoft, Honeywell and General Electric that beat consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) stocks rose sharply, helping to steady the broader market. But GE's (NYSE:GE) cut of its free cash flow forecast for the year overshadowed its earnings and revenue beat, pressuring the stock more than 4% lower.
Financials also underpinned the broader market as a string of mostly better-than-expected results from major Wall Street banks kept demand elevated.
Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reported above-consensus earnings this week, adding to a bullish report from JPMorgan last week.
Energy, however, weighed on sentiment as energy stocks shrugged off the a rise in U.S. oil prices Friday.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery rose $1.30 to settle at $70.46 a barrel. That, however, failed to prevent oil prices slipping to a second-straight weekly loss amid a slump earlier in the week.
On the currency front, the US Dollar Index Futures had its worst day in a month, supporting upside in the equities, as President Donald Trump slammed the Federal Reserve's monetary policy measures, arguing that higher interest rates were denting the United States' ""big competitive edge.""

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-monday-2005450,"Oct 28, 2019","Investing.com -- It's a big week ahead for global markets, with the Fed expected by many to cut interest rates again after another quarter of insipid economic growth (figures for that are also due out on Wednesday). It's also been a big weekend for Argentina, where left-wing populists returned to power in a fresh sign of unrest sweeping across South America, and for Microsoft, which notched a big win in the Cloud against arch-rival Amazon. Meanwhile in Europe, the EU formally agreed to a three-month extension of the deadline for Brexit. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 28th October.
1. Stocks to open near all-time highs
U.S. stock markets are set to open with a fresh run at all-time highs on Monday after China’s Ministry of Commerce said at the weekend that technical consultations on some parts of the interim trade deal being hammered out with the U.S. were “basically completed.”
By 6 AM ET, Dow futures were up 74 points or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.3%.
The news comes at the start of a big week for global markets, which have been dragged lower for most of the year by the economic slowdown caused by the U.S.-China trade dispute. The dispute has caused an economic slowdown that has forced most of the world’s central banks to ease monetary policy substantially. Both sides have claimed in the last few days that technical agreements on an interim trade are basically completed.
The Federal Reserve’s policy-making committee is due to decide on Wednesday whether or not to cut interest rates for a third time this year (Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool says there’s a 93% chance). That will follow the first reading for U.S. GDP in the third quarter. The Bank of Japan will hold its own policy-making meeting on Thursday, while the euro zone will release 3Q GDP on the same day.
2. Microsoft's JEDI victory over Bezos
The U.S. government awarded a multi-billion dollar contract for cloud computing services to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), dealing a blow to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the biggest player in the sector.
The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract, or JEDI as it’s inevitably known, could be worth as much as $10 billion, according to reports.
The award is the clearest illustration yet of the growing threat to Amazon Web Services’ dominance of the cloud-hosting business. That’s important because AWS has been by far the biggest profit generator for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in recent years. Earnings released last week showed that AWS’s quarterly sales growth slowed to 35%, while Microsoft’s Azure unit grew by 59%.
Others investing heavily in rivalling Amazon include Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL),   Alibaba   (NYSE:BABA) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).
 3. Alphabet's earnings due; LVMH bids for Tiffany
Alphabet heads the list of companies reporting quarterly earnings Monday. It’s expected to report earnings per share of $12.28 on $40.3 billion of revenue after the closing bell.
Also reporting after the bell will be Beyond Meat, T-Mobile US and chipmaker NXP.
To get the ball rolling before the opening, there’ll also be updates from Walgreens Boots Allianceand AT&T, which will be scrutinized for the pace of debt reduction and the company’s plans for HBO in the ongoing streaming wars.
Earlier in Europe, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) reported earnings a little ahead of expectations, while Europe’s largest bank HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) signalled a major restructuring ahead after reporting a 24% drop in profit in the third quarter. Meanwhile, LVMH (PA:LVMH) confirmed an approach for Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF), reported to be in the region of $14.5 billion.
4. EU approves Brexit extension
The European Union formally agreed to a three-month extension of the deadline for Brexit until the end of January 2020, according to a tweet from EU Council President Donald Tusk.
The exact terms, which will be formalized in writing later, are expected to include the possibility of an earlier exit if the U.K. parliament can ratify the withdrawal agreement struck 10 days ago by the EU and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The House of Commons is scheduled to vote later Monday not on the withdrawal agreement, but on whether to hold a general election in December in the hope of breaking the deadlock on Brexit. The chance of the House passing legislation enacting the withdrawal agreement before the proposed election date is slim.
The pound posted modest gains to stand at $1.2848, while the euro inched higher against the dollar to $1.1093
5. Peronists sweep back to power in Argentina
The left-wing populist candidate Alberto Fernandez won Argentina’s presidential election, posing fresh questions about the stability of the G20 country, which is struggling to meet the terms of its $56 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
Argentina’s central bank immediately tightened existing capital controls, cutting the amount of dollars it would allow people to buy to $200 a month from the previous limit of $10,000.
The result shows spreading discontent in South America, caused not least by the Fed’s tightening of U.S. interest rates last year and the drop in commodity prices as a result of China’s economic slowdown. In the last month alone, there have been fatal civil disturbances in Chile and Ecuador, the latter of which is also struggling under an IMF program.",0.9538

Plus, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg starts two days of testimony in front of Congress about the 737 MAX. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 29th October.
1. The Saudi Aramco IPO is here (probably)
Saudi Aramco, the world’s most profitable company, is finally set to being marketing its initial public offering on Sunday, Saudi state TV reported.
The news triggered selling in European stock markets Tuesday, as portfolio managers made room in their portfolios for what is expected to be a large block of shares by paring existing holdings. 
Questions still remain about the company’s valuation. While the country’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had sought a valuation of $2 trillion, reports suggest bankers have guided for somewhere between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion. If the deal does go ahead, it will represent a substantial payday for Wall Street banks involved in it.
The Al-Arabiya channel said the company intends to start trading on the local Tadawul market on Dec. 4.
2. Oil prices slip on Russian comments; API data due
Crude oil prices fell to their lowest in nearly a week after Russian deputy energy minister Pavel Sorokin said it was still too early to commit to additional measures to stabilize a market haunted by the threat of oversupply.
Sorokin said in an interview with Tass that the existing output restraint agreement, which has held 1.2 million barrels a day of crude back from world markets, has been effective so far. It’s consistent with previous official Russian comments suggesting that they expect this year’s slide in prices to stop any further loss of market share to U.S. shale producers.
Oil traders didn’t lose any time remarking that the planned Dec. 4 stock market debut of Aramco is just one day before Russia, OPEC and other major exporters meet in Vienna to review the output restraint deal, which is scheduled to run through the end of March.
Later Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly data for U.S. crude oil inventories. Analysts expect the official government data to show a build of 729,000 barrels.
3. Stocks set for lower open as Fed meets
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, with the start of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting deterring bets on new record highs.
By 6:30 AM ET, Dow futures were down 55 points or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures were down 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 Futures were flat.
Tuesday’s earnings parade is a cast of thousands, with the following companies all set to report: Mastercard, Merck, Pfizer, Amgen, Stryker, Mondelez, ConocoPhillips(NYSE:COP), S&P Global Inc (NYSE:SPGI), Marsh McLennan, AMD, Shopify, Allstate, Electronic Arts, Corning, Edison, Kellogg, KKR, Martin Marietta, Mattel and FireEye.
In Europe,   BP   (LON:BP) kicked off earnings season for Big Oil with a 41% drop in underlying net profit that kept its debt levels slightly above its targeted range.
4. Alphabet's rising cost problem
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, said revenue grew 20% to $40.5 billion in the third quarter but profits still disappointed due to rising costs, not least the cost of bulking up its cloud-computing business, where it has much ground to make up on rivals Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The shares fell 2% in after-hours trading.
Overall profit of $7.1 billion was down 23% from a year earlier and some 15% below analysts’ expectations.
Together with disappointing results from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the numbers suggest that Big Tech is starting to suffer from cost inflation, even if it’s still churning out healthy amounts of cash. The company’s payroll expanded by some 6% in the quarter to over 114,000.
Elsewhere after Monday’s closing bell, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) fell 10% despite posting its first quarterly profit and raising its revenue outlook. The post-IPO lockup on investors expires today.
5. Boeing's Muilenburg due before Congress
Boeing (NYSE:BA) chief executive Dennis Muilenburg is due to start two days of testimony before Congress regarding the 737 MAX scandal.
In prepared statements for his Senate testimony later today, Muilenburg will admit “mistakes” and repeat promises that the company will never let similar mistakes happen again.
How convincing Muilenburg’s testimony is could have a big influence on the regulatory backlash coming its way. Peter DeFazio, the chairman of the House of Representatives transport committee, told reporters on Monday said he would propose a new law overhauling the regulatory system, which lets the Federal Aviation Administration pass on responsibility for approving design changes to aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing (NYSE:BA).",0.74

“This outperformance, driven by secular growth and the death of the reflation narrative, has created positioning extremes, factor crowding and difficult-to-decipher risk narratives (e.g. FAAMG’s realized volatility is now below that of Staples and Utilities.” Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.
However, the slump in tech stocks was offset by a rise in financials, mostly banks, spurred by investor optimism that the sector would advance, after parts of the post-crisis Dodd-Frank financial regulations were tapered on Thursday.
The US House of Representatives on Thursday, passed legislation to roll back parts of the Obama-era, post-crisis Dodd-Frank financial regulations.
Meanwhile, a surprise result in the UK general election, which saw UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative party fail to secure enough seats to form a majority in Parliament drew a muted reaction from U.S. equities.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-friday-1538158,"Jul 20, 2018","Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, July 20:
1. Trump takes aim at Fed
U.S. President Donald Trump broke a long-held presidential tradition of not weighing in on Federal Reserve’s monetary policy when he criticized the central bank’s plans for gradual interest rate hikes.
The Fed raised has rates twice so far this year and Trump expressed his disappointment in a CNBC interview late Thursday.
“I’m not thrilled,” Trump said. “Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I don't really — I am not happy about it. But at the same time I’m letting them do what they feel is best.”
Markets are forecasting that the Fed will hike rates again in September and put the probability for an additional increase in December at around 60%.
The dollar, which is has been buoyed by expectations of further rate increase, was trading lower against major rivals after three straight days of gains.
2. Microsoft jumps on earnings with GE and Honeywell on tap
Corporate earnings will continue to weigh heavily on market direction amid a lack of top-tier economic data on the calendar for Friday.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock jumped 3.9% in pre-market trade after reporting better-than-expected quarterly numbers that were boosted by cloud services revenue. The Dow component reported earnings of $1.13 cents per share on $30.09 billion in revenue. That was above Wall Street estimates of $1.08 per share on revenue of $29.21 billion.
Quarterly earnings from both  General Electric  Company (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON), due before the open on Friday, will likely garner the most attention amid a slew of earnings from several companies including Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, State Street, SunTrust Banks and others.
3. Yuan undergoes volatility after Trump attack, China fixing
Market participants kept a close eye on volatility in USD/CNY on Friday as Trump commented on the Chinese currency but China’s central bank also weakened its daily reference rate.
In the CNBC interview Trump commented that a strong dollar puts the U.S. at a disadvantage and emphasized that the Chinese yuan ""was dropping like a rock"".
However, that didn’t stop the the People's Bank of China from dropping the midpoint for a seventh straight trading day to 6.7671 per dollar on Friday, 605 pips or 0.9% weaker than the previous fix of 6.7066.
Friday's fixing was the lowest since July 14, 2017, and represented the biggest one-day weakening in percentage terms since June 27, 2016.
The yuan treaded water after tumbling to a one-year low earlier, with some observers suggesting that Chinese banks began buying the yuan and selling dollar in an apparent attempt to prop the currency up.
4. U.S. stock futures point to mixed open despite Microsoft support
U.S. futures pointed to a mixed open on Friday as Microsoft’s positive earnings supported tech stocks but investors generally remained cautious. At 6:01 AM ET (10:01 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures slipped 17 points, or 0.07%, S&P 500 futures dropped less than a point, or 0.01%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 28 points, or 0.38%.
European stocks were mostly higher nearing their midday trade as investors concentrated on earnings news and digested Trump’s comments about the Fed and the strong dollar.
Earlier, Asian shares underwent volatile trade as investors kept their focus on the yuan.
5. Oil prices head higher, despite weekly decline
Oil prices headed higher on Friday, recovering some of its weekly decline, as traders focused on comments that Saudi Arabia would reduce exports in August and waited for the latest weekly data on U.S. drilling activity.
Saudi Arabia’s OPEC governor Adeeb Al Aama said that exports in July from the cartel’s top producer would be roughly in line with the 7.2 billion barrels per day that were exported in June, according to a Dow Jones report.
He further noted that the kingdom plans to cut exports by roughly 100,000 barrels per day in August as it works to ensure it does not push oil into the market beyond customers' needs, avoiding worries that oversupply would curtail prices.
Al Aama indicated that concerns that Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer and the cartel’s de facto leader, and its partners would oversupply markets are ""without basis"".
U.S. crude oil futures gained 0.66% to $68.69 at 6:03 AM ET (10:03 GMT), while Brent oil traded up 0.80% to $73.16.
Still, oil is on track for weekly losses of about 3% and has declined nearly 8% this month as supply concerns weighed on crude prices.
U.S. production will also be in focus later on Friday when Baker Hughes releases its weekly report on drilling activity. The U.S. oil rig count remained unchanged at 863 last week, as drillers appeared to hold output steady given the decline in prices.",0.9174

1. All eyes on ECB, Draghi for taper clues
Market players awaited the outcome of the European Central Bank's meeting for fresh clues on when it will start to shift away from its ultra-easy policy.
The ECB's interest rate decision is due at 1145GMT (7:45AM ET), with no big changes expected.
Most of the focus will be on President Mario Draghi's press conference 45 minutes after the announcement, as investors look for more clues on when and how the ECB could scale back its massive quantitative easing program.
Market experts believe the central bank is likely to wait until September before announcing a tapering of its 60 billion euros of monthly asset purchases.
The euro pulled back slightly from its highest level since May 2016 against the dollar, easing 0.1% to around the 1.1500-level.
2. BOJ cuts inflation outlook while keeping policy steady
Ahead of the ECB, the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as a two-day meeting concluded.
The central bank also pushed back the timing for achieving its 2% inflation target, reinforcing expectations it will lag well behind major global central banks in dialing back its massive stimulus program.
The dollar rose more than 0.3% against the yen to about 112.30, off the prior session's more than three-week low of 111.54.
3. Global stocks hit record highs
The MSCI World index inched up in its 10th straight session of gains and set a record high for the sixth consecutive day, lifted by all-time closing highs on Wall Street in the wake of strong earnings reports.
Asian shares rose to their highest levels in nearly a decade, as investors digested the Bank of Japan's dovish policy announcement.
European shares extended their gains, lifted by buoyant global markets, hours ahead of a highly anticipated policy meeting at the European Central Bank.
On Wall Street, U.S. futures pointed to a flat open ahead of the release of key earnings reports.
4. Microsoft eBay, Visa earnings in focus
Market participants will continue to keep an eye on the U.S. quarterly reporting season with the focus on earnings from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Visa (NYSE:V) all out after the closing bell. Capital One is also due after the close.
Earnings expected before the opening bell include Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK),  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), Travelers (NYSE:TRV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) and  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP).

The only question is how large of a cut will the Fed deliver at its July 30-31 policy meeting. Markets have fully priced in a 25-basis point cut. There is also a 30% probability of a 50 bps cut.

Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.27% after the Bank of Japan on Tuesday held its asset purchases at ¥80 trillion annually as expected, with the short-term interest rate maintained at 0.1%.
The BoJ also kept its core inflation forecast at 1.8% for FY2019/20, unchanged from July as it reiterated its view on the economy that risks are balanced. Earlier in Japan, household spending for September rose 0.4% on month, beating the 0.1% gain seen, and at a 0.3% decline on year, missing the 0.7% gain expected. As well, industrial production fell 1.1% on month provisionally, less than the 1.5% decline seen. The unemployment rate in Japan was steady at 2.8%.
Nintendo on Monday announced it was nearly doubling its full-year profit forecast to 120 billion yen ($1.06 billion) from 65 billion yen.

Overnight, U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday as gains in tech stocks were offset by a slump in financials following a report suggesting that the House is considering a plan that would gradually lower the U.S. corporate tax rate.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 23,348.74. The S&P 500 closed 0.32% higher while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 6698.96, down 0.03%.
In what was quiet day on calendar for top-tier corporate earnings, investors mulled over a Bloomberg report suggesting that the U.S. House of Representatives was discussing a gradual tax cut that that would lower the corporate tax rate to 20% in 2022.
On the economic data front, the trend of stuttering inflation continued while consumer spending grew at its fastest rate since August 2009.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 1.3% in the 12 months through September.
That was in-line with expectations but well below the Fed’s 2% target, fueling expectations that the trend of subdued inflation will keep interest rates lower for longer.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1% last month, the Commerce Department said on Monday.
The duo of reports come ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting which gets underway on Tuesday.
A surge in the tech stocks helped limit losses in the broader market as sentiment on tech remained elevated following a slew of better-than-expected earnings from Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week.",0.8807

With the earnings season well underway, investors cheered better-than-expected earnings from both Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), as the latter posted an increase in revenue for the first time in four quarters.
Pfizer's total revenue rose 1% to $13.17 billion, in-line with Wall Street estimates but tightened its revenue forecast to $52.4 billion to $53.1 billion, from $52 billion to $54 billion.
Despite beating earnings estimates,  Under Armour  Inc A (NYSE:UAA) slumped more than 20% as the sports apparel maker cut its revenue growth outlook for the year amid intense competition in North America from both  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (DE:ADSGN).
The mixed batch of earnings came as economic data beat expectations, raising expectations that U.S. economic growth remains on track for a solid final quarter of the year.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge rose to 125.9 in October from 119.8 in September, beating economists’ forecast for a reading of 121.
Consumer sentiment is a leading indicator of consumer spending, which plays a major role in overall economic activity.
The Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 66.2, above the September reading of 65.2. That topped expectations for a reading of 61. As a leading indicator of the U.S. economy, the Chicago PMI helps economists measure business activity and new orders.

""The U.S. has no interest in regime change or accelerated reunification of Korea. We do not seek an excuse to garrison U.S. troops north of the Demilitarized Zone,"" the officials said, addressing some of Pyongyang's fears that Washington ultimately intends to replace the reclusive country's leadership.
Meanwhile, better-than-expected Japanese economic data, pointing to an uptick in global growth, lifted investor sentiment on risker assets.
Japanese second-quarter growth expanded 1% quarter-on-quarter, on the back of a rise in consumption and capital expenditure, beating economists’ forecasts of a 0.6% increase.
The move higher in U.S. stocks come ahead of key U.S. data due this week, with retail sales data and the minutes from Federal Reserve’s July meeting slated for Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
Investors will parse the minutes for any update concerning the Fed’s plan to reduce its $4.5tn balance sheet and further insight into the central bank’s thinking concerning future monetary policy.

Higher interest rates are seen as boon for banks, boosting net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
Initial jobless claims in the period running from Aug. 27 to Sept. 2 surged by 62,000 to 298,000, reaching the highest level since spring 2015, the Labor Department said Thursday.
The fall in expectations of an additional rate hike later this year comes against comments from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who said that the gradual increases in the fed-funds rate will be needed to sustain the expansion and mitigate risks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61%, the S&P 500 lost 0.75%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.57%.
Powell said the central bank's current path of monetary policy was appropriate, cooling investor expectations that the central bank's next move on policy would be a rate cut rather than a hike.
“We do think our policy stance is appropriate right now. We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction,” Powell said during a news conference after the central bank’s policy meeting this week.
Powell's remarks arrived after the Fed left its benchmark unchanged and signaled that its future policy decisions would continue to be led by incoming economic data, and investors hoping for an interest-rate cut reacted by selling heavily after 2:30 p.m. ET.
The sea of red across markets pushed tech stocks into negative territory despite a 4.9% rally in Apple.

1. Facebook surges on user engagement, shrugs off FTC fine
Shares in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) surged more than 8% in premarket trade Thursday after the social media company reported strong first-quarter results and set aside $3 billion for a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Revenue and sales in the first three months of the year beat estimates, while user engagement metrics, key for social media, showed strong growth. Monthly active users and average revenue per user were both better than expected.
Facebook expects the FTC fine to range between $3 billion - $5 billion, which would be the largest civil penalty ever paid to the agency.
Even a fine of $5 billion would only represent a third of Facebook’s first-quarter revenue and, more importantly for investors, would end the investigation into whether Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million of its users with Cambridge Analytica.
2. Microsoft adds to upbeat sentiment in tech
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) added its own upbeat contribution to the wider tech narrative with first-quarter profit and sales beating expectations thanks to a strong contribution from its cloud-based services.
Shares jumped more than 4% in premarket trade.
However, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 0.4% after posting a wider-than-expected loss, accompanied by a heavy hint from CEO Elon Musk that the company would have to raise more capital. He also predicted a return to profitability in the third quarter.
Thursday’s session will face another torrent of earnings with 3M (NYSE:MMM) (NYSE:MMM), UPS and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reporting before the bell and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) (NASDAQ:INTC), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (NASDAQ:AMZN), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) (NASDAQ:SBUX) after the close.

3. Wall Street points to flat open despite tech support
U.S. futures pointed to a flat open on Thursday as the spotlight remains on earnings. Dow futures struggled to move into positive territory while the tech sector was buoyed by Facebook and Microsoft.
An accommodative Federal Reserve and a strong start to earnings season were the keys to U.S. stocks hitting record highs this week. The S&P retreated from those dizzying heights on Wednesday, consolidating ahead of the next round of results.
At 5:50 AM ET (9:50 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures slipped 20 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures were little changed, while the Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 8 points, or 0.1%.
4. Dollar hits fresh 2019 highs, BoJ supports
The dollar hit fresh 2019 highs against major rivals on Thursday as the Bank of Japan lent support with a dovish outlook.
The BoJ announced that it expected to keep interest rates at extremely low levels through at least spring 2020.
The BoJ joined the chorus of central banks focusing on a pledge to maintain accommodation. The Bank of Canada cut its growth forecasts on Wednesday and abandoned its previous language about possible rate hikes.
Although the Federal Reserve is not expected to make changes to monetary policy next week at a regular meeting, recent strength in stock markets may lead it to hold off from considering the possibility of further accommodation.
5. Durable goods orders seen rebounding
Durable goods orders highlight the Thursday’s economic calendar a day ahead of the first-quarter GDP release.
The Commerce Department will release the latest figures on orders for long-lasting goods at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).

 Lennar  (NYSE:LEN), KB Home (NYSE:KBH) and PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) also closed lower.
On the economic front, durable goods orders topped economists' expectations, but jobless claims jumped by more than expected. The mixed economic data comes a day ahead of preliminary first-quarter U.S. GDP numbers.

At the close of U.S. trading, the Dow 30 rose 0.97%, the S&P 500 index rose 0.81%, while the NASDAQ Composite index rose 0.85%.
The Federal Reserve Board of Governors agreed at their April policy meeting that the time has come to discuss ways to wrap up monetary stimulus programs, though rate hikes aren't on the drawing board yet, as no inflationary risks have become evident due to ultra-loose policies.
Stocks rose on the somewhat dovish report.
The Fed is currently purchasing $45 billion in Treasury and mortgage debt a month to spur recovery, a monetary policy tool known as quantitative easing that suppresses long-term interest rates, weakening the dollar while boosting stock prices on hopes investing and hiring will follow suit.
The Fed's current asset-purchasing plan kicked off at $85 billion in 2012, though further tapering will be likely as the economy stands on its own two feet.
Monetary authorities agreed at their April meeting to seek out a mix of tools to normalize monetary policy and wind down the bond-buying program, which came as little surprise, though the U.S. central bank didn't spell out exactly when benchmark interest-rate hikes would begin, which drew applause on Wall Street.
""Participants generally agreed that starting to consider the options for normalization at this meeting was prudent, as it would help the Committee to make decisions about approaches to policy normalization and to communicate its plans to the public well before the first steps in normalizing policy become appropriate,"" the minutes from the Fed's April 29-30 meeting read.
""Early communication, in turn, would enhance the clarity and credibility of monetary policy and help promote the achievement of the Committee's statutory objectives.""
The Fed also added that stimulus programs have not fueled inflationary pressures as of now, which gives monetary authorities flexibility to manage the economy that would spur job creation without escalating consumer prices.
""It was also noted that because inflation was expected to remain well below the Committee's 2 percent objective and the unemployment rate was still above participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level, the Committee did not, at present, face a tradeoff between its employment and inflation objectives, and an expansion of aggregate demand would result in further progress relative to both objectives,"" the minutes read.
Leading Dow Jones Industrial Average performers included Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), up 1.91%, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), up 1.68%, and United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX), up 1.55%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average's worst performers included AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), down 0.66%, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), down 0.05%, and Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD), which was up 0.13%.

In earnings, Google’s parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) sunk more than 5% in the pre-market as results reported after Thursday’s close were hit by higher traffic costs and a stronger dollar.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was down close to 5% after both revenue and profit missed consensus.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) also fell 4% as sales growth fell short of expectations.
For Friday’s session, blue chips McDonald’s, Caterpillar and General Electric were all set to report quarterly earnings.
As attention began to shift to next week’s Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy decision, the dollar edged up to one-week highs.
Though the Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged, markets were waiting to see if the U.S. central bank would take on a more hawkish tone.
Specifically, the U.S. Dollar Index, that gauges the greenback’s value against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.23% to 94.84, at 10:48AM GMT, or 6:48AM ET.

And GE fell more than 1% after missing consensus on revenue.
In other negative reports, Google’s parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) sunk more than 6% as results reported after Thursday’s close were hit by higher traffic costs and a stronger dollar.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) also fell close to 6% as sales growth fell short of expectations.
 Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) also traded down more than 1% after missing by a penny on EPS and cutting its annual sales and profit forecast.
Attempting to buck the general trend, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) traded flat after beating on both earnings and revenue.
Meanwhile, attention began to shift to next week’s Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy decision which will be announced on April 27.
The Fed was widely expected to leave rates untouched with not a single one of the 80 analysts surveyed in a recent Reuters’ poll counting on a hike at the meeting.
For the meeting itself, markets were waiting to see if the U.S. central bank would take on a more hawkish tone, especially considering that 50 of the experts in the poll expected the increase in interest rates to occur at the June meeting.
The Federal funds rate was pricing interest rates to be at 0.75-1.00 at the end of the year, implying at least two hikes this year, in line with the Fed officials’ own median forecast.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.27% at 94.88, at 14:55GMT, or 12:55ET.
On a light economic calendar, Markit’s manufacturing PMI for April unexpectedly declined, marking the weakest upturn in six-and-a-half years.
“With prior months’ survey data pointing to annualized GDP growth of just 0.7% in the first quarter, the deteriorating performance of manufacturing suggests that growth could weaken closer towards stagnation in the second quarter,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson warned.
Additionally, crude shot up on Friday and was on track to be not only its third consecutive week of gains, but also one of its biggest weekly rallies this year.
Investors waited for the U.S. rig count data from Baker Hughes which will be released later on Friday.

At 11:54AM ET (15:54GMT), the Dow Jones gained 46 points, or 0.26%, while the S&P 500 advanced 5 points, or 0.24%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite inched up 5 points, or 0.09%.
The Bank of Japan (BoJ) rebooted its stimulus program Wednesday with new tactics, although the Japanese central bank left interest rates and asset purchases unchanged.
Amid the actual changes, the BoJ removed the cap to its inflation target stating its intention to continue intervention until inflation exceeds the 2% mark “and stays above the target in a stable manner”.
Furthermore, it implemented a so-called “yield curve control” which is designed to cap 10-year government bond yields at 0%.
Japanese equities and the dollar-yen initially spiked, with the Nikkei 225 pocketing gains of 1.9% and the USD/JPY initially rising by more than 1% to a session high of 102.78 immediately after the BoJ's policy decision.
However, sentiment ran out and the yen turned around as skepticism over the tweaks to policy began to grow throughout Wednesday’s session.
Meanwhile, crude oil benefitted from a surprise drop in U.S. inventories. The knee-jerk reaction took black gold to intraday highs and, though gains were later pared, West Texas remained above the $45 psychological level.
U.S. crude oil futures gained 2.61% to $45.20 by 11:56AM ET (15:56GMT), while Brent oil rose 2.11% to $46.85.
With these two events under their belt, market participants adjusted trades in anticipation of its appointment with the Fed.
The Fed is not expected to make a move on interest rates at 2:00PM ET (18:00GMT) on Wednesday, but investors will first focus on the statement and updated forecasts for economic growth and interest rates that will be released simultaneously with the rate decision for a first gauge on when the central bank contemplates returning to policy normalization.
Fed chair Janet Yellen will then hold what will be a closely-watched press conference 30 minutes after the release as investors look for any change in tone about the economy or future rate hikes.
Markets are currently pricing in just a 15% chance of a rate hike at this meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. For the meetings in November and December odds stood at 24.8% and 60.7%, respectively.
With nothing else of note on the economic calendar Wednesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) cut its forecast for global growth to 2.9% this year, down from a forecast of 3.0% in its last estimates in June. This was the lowest level since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.
""This is well below past norms and implies that globalization as measured by trade intensity may have stalled,"" the Paris-based organization said.
The OECD also cut its forecast for growth in the U.S. economy to 1.4% this year, from the prior estimate of 1.8%.
On the business front, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares rose more than 1% after the tech giant raised its quarterly dividend by 8% on Tuesday and said it would buy back up to $40 billion as part of a new share repurchase program.
In big movers on earnings, shares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) jumped more than 6% after the shipping giant released better than expected quarterly results after Tuesday's closing bell.
Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) rallied close to 7% after the software company reported quarterly earnings of 75 cents per share late Tuesday, beating expectations of 72 cents per share.

Among Dow components,  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) will likely add to the bullish sentiment in stocks as its shares surged more than 6% in pre-market trade Thursday on the back of an increased profit forecast released with better-than-expected revenue after the market close a day earlier.

With regard to the U.S. central bank, New York Fed chief William Dudley has a busy schedule with appearances throughout the day.
Late Wednesday, Dudley made it clear that he expects the Fed to hike rates this year.
December remained the markets’ best bet for a move with odds standing at 64.8%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Meanwhile, oil prices slumped around 1% on Thursday as traders locked in profits following a rally in the previous session when the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported an unexpectedly large U.S. oil inventory drawdown last week.
Crude rallied on Wednesday, with U.S. crude settling at a 15-month high after the EIA said U.S. oil inventories fell by 5.2 million barrels last week, compared to forecasts for a stockpile build of 2.7 million barrels.
Oil was also under pressure as a committee meeting which would could the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that non-OPEC member Russia would also attend neared at the end of next week in Vienna.
The October 28-29 gathering was set up to hammer out preliminary details of the expected output cut at OPEC’s official meeting on November 30, but analysts were skeptical of their capability to reach a meaningful agreement and doubts over a Russia’s participation weighed on prices. 
U.S. crude futures fell 1.00% to $51.30 by 6:53AM ET (10:53AM GMT), while Brent oil lost 1.03% to $52.13.
Elsewhere, eyes were on the European Central Bank's latest interest rate decision due at 11:45GMT (7:45AM ET) on Thursday, with most of the focus likely to be on president Mario Draghi's press conference 45 minutes after the announcement.
The ECB is not expected to move on rates, but Draghi could offer fresh clues on the time frame of its €80 billion monthly asset-buying program, due to run out in March.
A recent Reuters poll of economists showed that a stable but lackluster economic outlook will push the ECB to extend its stimulus program by year-end, although such a move will likely be reserved for December’s meeting when the central bank’s updated quarterly projections will be available.
Ahead of the events, the euro was trading unchanged at a three-month low against the dollar.
European stocks were also mostly flat, holding onto slight gains, in anticipation of the monetary policy announcement.

In an evident sign of economic worries from the U.K.’s decision to leave the EU, industry data on Tuesday showed that economic sentiment in Germany, the euro area’s number one economy, had already deteriorated to the lowest level since November 2012 in July, as the Brexit shock hit business confidence.
With Fed fund futures still dismissing the possibility of a rate hike by the U.S. central bank, it seemed that global economic concerns were responsible for the dollar’s move to four-month highs.

Stocks on the major indices rebounded on Tuesday morning after the U.S. Commerce Department said that new home sales in April soared 16.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000, the highest monthly gain in nearly 25 years. With the sharp gains, new home sales surged to their highest level since January, 2008, topping the next closest reading by more than 70,000.

Trip Advisor shares fell mildly after prominent restaurateur David Moore called the travel website ""a monster spiraling out of control,"" while telling the Daily Mail of London that reviewers should show tangible evidence that they have eaten at a restaurant ""before they can slam it.""
Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) added 0.38 or 10.35% to 4.05, finishing as the top performer on the S&P 500. It came as energy stocks received a boost from rising oil prices, after U.S. crude futures gained more than 1% to hit a fresh 7-month high near $49 a barrel. The worst performer was CF Industries Holdings Inc (NYSE:CF), which plunged 2.24 or 7.50% to 27.61.

Elsewhere, United Technologies shares experienced one of its worst trading days since the reopening of markets following the aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy, nearly 15 years ago.

Capitol Police Sergeant of Arms told Reuters and the Associated Press that one police officer was not seriously wounded, while the shooter had been placed in custody.

At 15:00GMT or 11:00AM ET, the Dow 30 slipped 33 points, or 0.19%, while the S&P 500 edged down 2 points, or 0.09%, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite advanced 11 points, or 0.24%.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index rose more-than-expected in March and managed to pare losses seen at the start of trade on Wall Street, while the S&P/Case-Shiller house price index for January coming just under forecasts did little to move sentiment.
Market participants seemed reluctant to make big trades ahead of Yellen’s upcoming speech to the Economic Club of New York (ECNY) while waiting to see if the Fed chair will give clues as to the future path or rate hikes. Of note, the ECNY has the speech scheduled for 11:30ET, but the Federal Reserve web page lists it to start at 12:20ET.
Since her dovish comments at the March 16 press conference after the policy decision, several Fed officials have made more hawkish remarks.
In this light, investors will be on edge to see if the Fed chief’s message has swayed and might give hints to future policy decisions.
Apart from Yellen, SF Fed chief Williams said earlier on Tuesday that his outlook on the U.S. economy was positive and reiterated that rate hikes would be “gradual and thoughtful”.
Additionally, New York Fed chief William Dudley and Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan will speak at 16:00GMT, or 12:00ET, and 17:00GMT, or 13:00ET, respectively.
Meanwhile, oil moved lower among fears that the rebound from February’s low has run its course with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts suggesting that the barrel of crude could return to near $30 and continuing doubts over the effectiveness of any possible agreement among major oil producers to confront the global supply glut. Iran plans on attending the April 17 meeting, though the country will not partake in any production freeze, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
Concerns were also raised while waiting for inventory data which could show that U.S. stockpiles rose once again to record highs. The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly inventory data on Tuesday at 20:35GMT, or 16:35ET, while the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration will publish its report on Wednesday at 14:30GMT, or 10:30AM ET.
Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost 3.25% to $38.11 a barrel by 15:03GMT or 11:03AM ET, while Brent oil fell 2.79% to $39.73.
In company news, after rumors that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could be organizing investors in a takeover bid for the troubled Internet portal, Yahoo!

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1% last month, the Commerce Department said on Monday.
The duo of reports come ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting which gets underway on Tuesday.
A surge in the tech stocks helped limit losses in the broader market as sentiment on tech remained elevated following a slew of better-than-expected earnings from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week.

In what a quiet day on the economic calendar, investor sentiment on equities remained upbeat as recent economic data pointed to the underlying strength of the U.S. economy while a rally in shares of major automakers lifted the broader market.
Shares of Ford, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler closed higher as the trio topped expectations for new vehicles sales in September.
“Data have been pretty strong over the past few days, and that’s giving a boost to markets around the globe. Valuations are elevated, but you can justify them,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP)”.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1.63%. The S&P 500 rose 1.86%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.95%. Strong gains for the Dow and Nasdaq saw both indexes escape correction territory, defined as a 10% decline from the most recent peak.
The major averages were rescued from correction territory as investors viewed the rout from a day earlier as a buying opportunity, with tech attracting the bulk of investor dollars following bullish earnings from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Microsoft posted earnings and revenue Wednesday after the close that handily beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares soaring nearly 6%. Twitter rallied more than 15% after comfortably exceeding consensus revenue and earnings estimates.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) swung to a surprise third-quarter profit, though some on Wall Street put the brakes on optimism, questioning whether this is ""as good as it gets"" for the electric automaker.
Tesla's exposure to China tariffs on imported components and its offering of lower-priced vehicles would likely compress margins in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs said. ""We question if this is not as good as it gets (for Tesla) from a near-term upside surprise for shares.""
Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), however, tempered optimism on earnings after it guided fourth-quarter revenues below consensus estimates. Its shares slumped about 15%.
Still, chipmakers managed a decent showing for the day, led by a rally in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). The SPDR S&P Semiconductor (NYSE:XSD) gained more than 2%, clawing back some losses from a day earlier, when the sector suffered its worst slump since Nov. 2018.
Energy also contributed to the rebound in the broader average as oil prices continued to pare early-week losses on renewed hopes that OPEC will cut supplies before the year is out.
The spring-loaded rebound on Wall Street comes as analysts asserted the recent selloff was overdone as the outlook for earnings and U.S. economic growth remained favourable.
""The nearly 10% decline in U.S. stocks over the last month appears excessive relative to the risks,"" said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Market participants will get a first look at the pace of U.S. economic growth on Friday, with the released of preliminary third-quarter GDP data.

The proposed meeting was originally scheduled for March, then pushed to April, and has now been pushed back to June, the South China Morning News reported on Saturday.
The delay indicates the two sides are far from an agreement on trade disputes, despite comments from both sides last week claiming that they had made progress.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.10%, the S&P 500 lost 0.01%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.12%. The Dow had been up about 196 points before the rally abruptly stalled.
Signs of mistrust between the U.S. and China poured cold water on expectations that a trade deal would be wrapped up sooner rather than later, prompting selling across trade-sensitive sectors such as industrials and materials.
Some U.S. officials fear that China is failing to honor certain trade concessions, Bloomberg reported Tuesday afternoon, citing people familiar with the negotiations. In addition, sources told Bloomberg China wants to cut the troubled Boeing 737 Max from the list of U.S. exports it would buy. Boeing (NYSE:BA) saw a rally trimmed to a small gain in regular trading and was off slightly after hours
The Bloomberg report arrived as a summit to conclude a U.S.-China trade deal was postponed from this month to April, with Beijing reportedly taking issue with Washington's demand for a unilateral enforcement framework.
Washington has argued that an enforcement framework is needed to ensure Beijing complies with eventual terms of a trade deal, or risk penalties for stepping out of line.
Beyond trade, consumer discretionary and health care delivered gains for the broader market led by L Brands (NYSE:LB) and Cigna (NYSE:CI).
Investor expectations for the Federal Reverse to deliver a dovish outlook on monetary policy on Wednesday also limited downside in the broader averages.
The central bank’s pledge to keep monetary policy tightening on hold has been a key driver for the rebound in stocks this year after the sharp slump at the end of last year.

In Thursday's session, the Dow surged 235.31 or 1.33% to 17,929.99, completing its third straight move of 150 points or higher. As a result, the Dow has shaved approximately 80% of its losses from a massive sell-off in the wake of the shocking Brexit decision when it plunged more than 850 points in two sessions. The S&P 500 Composite Index added 28.09 or 1.36% to 2,098.86, ending the first half up by more than 2%. For the session all 10 sectors closed in the green, as stocks in the Consumer Goods, Utilities and Basic Materials industries led. In total, seven sectors jumped by more than 1%, led by Consumer Goods, which surged by more than 12 points for the session.
The NASDAQ Composite index, meanwhile, added 63.42 or 1.33% to 4,842.67, amid continued gains among semiconductor stocks. Nevertheless, the NASDAQ closed lower for the second consecutive quarter, posting back-to-back quarterly losses for the first time in five years. Over the first half of the year, the NASDAQ has been pulled down by large-cap stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which have each fallen by more than 7% year to date. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have also provided a significant drag, moving lower for the third time over the last four quarters.
The top performer on the Dow was  General Electric  Company (NYSE:GE), which added 0.93 or 3.04% to 31.48. It came one day after the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) voted to remove GE's Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) designation, capping the multinational conglomerate's year-long effort to unwind GE Capital, its lucrative financial arm. Since announcing a transformation into a smaller, less risky financial services company last April, GE Capital has reduced its assets by roughly $180 billion. The ruling could enable GE to designate up to $20 billion for additional stock buybacks, according to company executives.
The worst performer was  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) which slid 2.57 or 3.35% to 74.17. Earlier, a U.S. Federal appeals court threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement  Visa and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) reached with millions of retailers in 2012, stemming from accusations that the credit card giants acted improperly in fixing credit and debit fees. The settlement, which could be renegotiated, is the largest all-cash, antitrust deal in U.S. history.
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was NetEase Inc (NASDAQ:NTES), which added 11.74 or 6.47% to 193.22. NetEase finished just above  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which held onto gains after Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) rejected the multinational confectionary food company's $23 billion offer on Thursday afternoon. Hershey stocks initially skyrocketed after the Wall Street Journal reported that Mondelez made a preliminary, non-binding attempt to acquire the Pennsylvania-based chocolate giant for a half-cash, half-stock bid, totaling $107 a share. Mondelez closed at 45.51, up 2.54 or 5.91%, while Hershey's soared 16.35 or 16.83% to 113.49.
""The Company’s Board of Directors, after receiving input from the Company’s management and its outside financial and legal advisors, carefully evaluated the indication of interest,"" Hershey's said in a statement. ""Following this review, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously rejected the indication of interest and determined that it provided no basis for further discussion between Mondelez and the Company.""
The worst performer was  Tractor Supply Company  (NASDAQ:TSCO), which slid 4.30 or 4.52% to 90.87. Tractor Supply built on sharp losses from Wednesday's after-hour session after the largest rural lifestyle retail store chain in the U.S. posted weak preliminary second quarter results and lowered its annual outlook.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 53.62 or 0.29% to 18,570.85, while the S&P 500 Composite index added 9.86 or 0.46% to 2,175.03, as U.S. equities stayed on pace for their strongest month since March. The indices have remained in record territory for the majority of the last two weeks, as signals of slowing growth in the euro area and Japan, as well as plunging global bond yields have sent investors fleeing to safety into stocks on Wall Street. The S&P 500 ended the week at its highest closing level on record. The NASDAQ Composite index, meanwhile, rose by 26.26 or 0.52% to 5,100.16, moving approximately 2% from hitting a record-high.
On the S&P 500, nine of 10 sectors closed in the green as stocks in the Telecommunications, Utilities and Financials industries led. The telecom sector received a boost from AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), which both gained more than 1% on the session. On Thursday evening, AT&T narrowly topped analysts' forecasts with its second quarter earnings, while increasing consolidated revenues by 22% to $40.5 billion for the three-month period ending in late-June. It came as the Dallas-based company reported a spike of 2.1 million wireless adds, 1.4 million of which came from the U.S.
Midway through the second quarter results period, approximately 3% of S&P 500 companies are reporting year-over-year earnings decreases, far below expectations for an aggregate decline of 4.5%, according to Reuters. Next week, roughly 40% of S&P 500 companies are set to report their quarterly earnings.
The top performer on the Dow was  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), which added 1.12 or 1.42% to 79.91. Visa finished just ahead of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which gained 0.77 or 1.38% to 56.57. Earlier this week, Microsoft topped analysts' earnings and revenue estimates after sales among its closely-watched cloud product more than doubled on the quarter. Microsoft shares are up roughly 6% since the Redmond, Washington-based company released their second quarter results on Tuesday night.
The worst performer was GE, which fell 0.53 or 1.63% to 32.06 in Friday's session, after failing to appease investor sentiments on Friday in spite of beating consensus forecasts with its quarterly results. Although GE's revenues rose sharply in the second quarter on an annual basis, investors placed closer attention to weakness in the locomotive and oil-field equipment segment, where orders fell 16%, ex-acquistion and currency shifts. GE had been one of the top components on the Dow since last May when it last hit all-time record highs.
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) PLC (NASDAQ:VOD), which added 1.23 or 4.09% to 31.34. Shares in Vodafone are still down nearly 20% over the last year, including 10% during the last three months. The worst performer was  Skyworks Solutions Inc  (NASDAQ:SWKS), which tumbled 6.11 or 8.62% to 64.81. Shares in the Skyworks Solutions plummeted one day after the semiconductor manufacturer said its profits fell 9% last quarter on an annual basis. Skyworks Solutions, one of the top suppliers for the iPhone, reportedly has seen its revenues dented as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) looks to reduce its channel inventory ahead of the iPhone 7 launch, according to a report from Fool.com.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-wednesday-1174885,"Jan 31, 2018","Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, January 31:
1. Fed rate decision on tap in last with Yellen as chair
The Federal Reserve is not expected to take action on interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting at 2:00PM ET (1900GMT) on Wednesday, keeping it in a range between 1.25%-1.50%.
The central bank will release its post-meeting statement as investors look for any change in language which could point more clearly to a rate hike in the months ahead.
This week's meeting will be the last under the leadership of Janet Yellen, before she is replaced by Fed Governor Jerome Powell.
The majority of economists believe that the Fed will hike rates in March, followed by another hike in June, with a third move higher arriving in December.
The dollar came under renewed selling pressure on Wednesday, sliding lower against a basket of the other major currencies ahead of the decision as well as another slew of economic data.
Close attention will be paid to ADP’s nonfarm employment report at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT) as a precursor to the government nonfarm payrolls out on Friday.
Market participants will also eye the Chicago purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for January out at 9:45AM ET (14:45GMT) as well as the release, 15 minutes later, of pending home sales for last month of 2017.
2. Trump brings infrastructure spending back on radar
President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Congress on Tuesday to pass legislation to stimulate at least $1.5 trillion in new infrastructure spending, though the he gave few details on the long-awaited spending plan.
In his State of the Union speech to Congress, Trump said it was time to address America's ""crumbling infrastructure.""
The President did seem wary of increasing the federal deficit which the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculates will pass $1 trillion dollars next year.
“Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private-sector investment,” he said.
3. Earnings season continues in full swing
Earnings season will continue in full swing on Wednesday with firms continuing to give a strong showing. As of Tuesday night, 169 of the S&P 500 firms had reported earnings with 82% beating profit estimates and 85% topping sales forecasts.
Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) registered gains of nearly 7% in pre-market trade Wednesday after the video game company produced a better-than-expected forward guidance after the prior session’s close.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) saw shares rise more than 2% in pre-market trade after beating on both the top and bottom line, benefiting from strong chip demand.
Among firms to watch on Wednesday, Boeing (NYSE:BA), DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) or Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) will report before the opening bell, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) or eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) will release their own earnings after the market close.
4. Oil heads for monthly gains of 6% ahead of inventories
Crude prices fell on Wednesday, extending losses into a third session, although the U.S. benchmark was still on track for monthly gains of around 6%.
Continuing concern over supply as U.S. shale producers pump more possibly offsetting OPEC-led production cuts and speculation that weekly supply data due later in the day will show an increase in U.S. oil and fuel inventories put downward pressure on oil prices on Wednesday.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by nearly 3.2 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a more modest increase of around 0.1 million barrels.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended Jan. 26 at 10:30AM ET (15:30GMT), amid expectations for a build of 126,000 barrels.
U.S. crude oil futures fell 0.60% to $64.11 at 5:58AM ET (11:58GMT), while Brent oil traded down 0.63% to $68.09.
5. Bitcoin on track for largest monthly decline in 4 years amid crypto bloodbath
All the major cryptocurrencies were trading lower across the board on Wednesday in the last trading day of the month while the largest by market cap, Bitcoin, was on track for the biggest monthly percentage decline since December 2013 amid growing fears over regulatory scrutiny.
Bitcoin slumped 6.3% at $10,199 by 5:58AM ET (11:58GMT) on the Bitfinex exchange. Prices are down around 25% so far this month, the worst monthly performance since December 2013.

Bitcoin prices came under renewed selling pressure on Thursday following reports that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sent subpoenas on Dec. 6 to cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and Tether.

Sentiment on earnings overall were mostly bullish, however, as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Paypal beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines, but the latter fell more than 5% following eBay’s announcement that it would ditch its long-term partnership Paypal.
Some noted, however, that eBay represented just 13% of PayPal’s total payment volume, according to company files.
Offsetting weakness in markets somewhat was strong performance in energy and financials amid the ongoing rally in crude prices and prospect of a more hawkish Federal Reserve on monetary policy, respectively.

Amazon reported earnings that beat on both the top and bottom line, while Alphabet missed earnings per share estimates but beat revenue estimates. Alphabet reported earnings of $9.70 per share on revenue of $32.32 billion compared with analysts' estimates for earnings of $9.70 per share on $31.86 billion on revenue.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-things-under-the-radar-this-week-1936602,"Jul 26, 2019","Investing.com - Here’s three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. Coke Is Goldilocks
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoyed one of its best weeks in a long time, rising more than 5.5%, tops among the 30 Dow stocks.
It hit a new high on Wednesday and is up 14.6% for the year.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoyed one of its best weeks in a long time, rising more than 5.5%, tops among the 30 Dow stocks.
Sure, the year-to-date return pales compared with Dow-leading Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 39% gain this year.
But Coca-Cola's return is deceiving, because it includes the drubbing the beverage giant suffered in mid-February after its fourth-quarter earnings report disappointed Wall Street and knocked the shares down about 10%, before bottoming on Feb. 19.
Since then, Coca-Cola is up 21%.
So, what happened? Original Coke products did well. So did Coke Zero Sugar, which has been growing a double-digit levels. In the beverage business, that's a big deal.
Second-quarter revenue grew 6% to $10 billion. Earnings per share jumped 13%. The company now expects full-year organic growth (reported growth less the effects of acquisitions and currency changes) to hit 5%. In February, the company was thinking 4% growth. 
But Coke's stock price may be vulnerable because it's hit a string of new highs recently. The shares are trading at 33x trailing earnings, a rich premium. Its relative strength index has topped 70 - a key technical level to judge overvaluation - several times in the last week.
But the dividend investor should like Coke. Its $1.20-a-share payout is stable and represents a yield of about 3%.
And Coke is a value play, never too hot and not too cold. The stock fell slightly in last year's fourth quarter, while the market overall was pummeled.
2. More Pain Ahead for European Banks?
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled a stimulus package was in the pipeline for September, sending Germany’s government bond yields to a record low.
Germany’s 10 year government bond yield hit a new all-time low of 0.422% on Thursday intraday, before paring some losses.
Analysts have previously warned that every 25 basis points additional of a rate cut may prove a drag of about 2% on earnings per share of banks.
“Low rates have hurt bank profitability in most developed markets for years now, and the pain doesn’t seem to be coming to an end any time soon,” said Jan Schildbach, head of research for banking and financial markets at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in Frankfurt.
Earnings from both UBS and Deutsche Bank this week gave traders an insight into the damage that negative rates may bring.
Deutsche warned that it expects European short-term rates will rise to just 0% (you read that right) in 2021.
""The bottom line for the banks in Europe is that low rates are a problem as they can't grow net interest income,"" said PM Capital's chief investment officer Paul Moore. ""They typically have cost inflation as they tend to be labor intensive banks and if you can't grow net interest income, it's hard to grow profits.""
The iShares STOXX Europe 600 (DE:STOXXIEX) ended the week down, adding to losses of more than 9% for the quarter.
With earnings from  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP)  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and Natixis (OTC:NTXFY) on the deck for next week, investors may have to brace for further gloom out from the region’s main banks.
3. Is Snap in a Netflix Trap?
Social media company Snap (NYSE:SNAP) reported earnings this week, with the investors applauding the results and shares jumping.
The company that runs Snapchat beat on the top and bottom lines and also on one of the key social media metrics, with daily active users rising to 203 million.
Once the black sheep of the social media crowd, derided by investors and Kylie Jenner alike, the company’s stock is now near a 52-week high.
Snap stressed that original content was not only a driver of results, but something it plans to focus on in the future.
The concentration is on Discover, an aspect of an app that is solely friend-to-friend which “is all about keeping (users) up-to-date on current events, pop culture”.
But that concentration could put Snap in the same quandary as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
The total daily time spent by Snapchat users watching Discover rose 60% from the year-ago period – clearly a big deal to the company’s growth strategy.
“We continue to invest in our Discover platform, with a particular focus on building a sustainable premium content ecosystem,” Snap said
That means a big continued investment in original content.
But just like Netflix, Snap is facing competitors with very big pockets like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).",0.895

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1843543,"Apr 23, 2019","Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. AT&T, Boeing, Caterpillar and More
As the earnings parade continues tomorrow, AT&T I(NYSE:T) reports tomorrow before the bell, following mixed results from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) today. Analysts are forecasting a profit of 86 cents per share on revenue of about $45 billion.
It’s not too long ago that these two telecom giants (now communications services companies according to S&P) would be all about wireless customers. But not today.
Verizon lost 44,000 wireless customers in its most recent quarter. But in AT&T’s case that metric will likely take a back seat given its control of Time Warner, with attention more on how HBO plans to battle Disney’s new streaming service Disney+.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) will also issue results, with analysts looking for earnings of $3.23 per share and revenue of $23 billion. Investors will want updates on the company’s grounded 737 MAX jetliner.
Fellow industrial  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) will also report. Analysts are forecasting a profit of $2.83 a share on revenue of $13.3 billion.
Also reporting are defense companies General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) and Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ).
2. Facebook, Microsoft Headline Postmarket Earnings
After the bell tomorrow the earnings calendar will be a tale of two techs: social media pioneer Facebook and software stalwart Microsoft.
On average, analysts expect that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) earned $1.61 per share in its first quarter, with revenue of about $15 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
As usual with social media companies, user engagement will also be closely watched. The company reported 2.32 billion monthly active users (MAUs) for the fourth quarter, which was up 9% from the year-ago period. Stock research firm Trefis predicts similar growth for the latest quarter, with MAUs rising to $2.5 billion by the end of 2020.
For Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), analysts are predicting a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) of $1 per share on revenue of about $32.7 billion.
The big takeaway will be the company’s cloud computing business, which is now the growth driver of sales. Its commercial cloud revenue rose 48% overall last quarter from the year-ago period. Revenue for cloud service Azure rose 76%, a sizable gain, but the same as the fiscal first quarter, raising some worries growth is leveling off.
Last month Mizuho initiated coverage on Microsoft with a buy, citing strong potential given 15% to 20% of work worldwide is done on the cloud, Barron’s reported.
3. Build in Crude Stockpiles Set to Resume?
Ahead of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday, investors got an early insight into weekly U.S. supplies, showing a build in weekly crude supplies.
The American Petroleum Institute data released Tuesday, while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels. It showed weekly crude stockpiles rose by 6.9 million barrels last week.
The EIA is expected to report a build in crude stockpiles of 1.255 million barrels for the week ended April 19. Crude inventories snapped a three-week build in the prior week, falling by 1.396 million barrels.
U.S. weekly production, which remains near record highs despite falling to 12.1 million barrels a day, will likely also attract attention.
Crude oil futures hit fresh 2019 highs, settling 1.1% higher at $66.30 today.",0.8552
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-thursday-2003090,"Oct 24, 2019","Investing.com -- Mario Draghi hosts his last press conference as head of the ECB, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is set to open at its highest in months after a surprise return to profit in the third quarter. Tech indexes remain supported by stronger-than-expected earnings from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) - and it'll be Amazon's turn to report after the closing bell. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 24th October.
1. Arriverderci, Mario
Mario Draghi presides over his last meeting at the European Central Bank before handing over to Christine Lagarde, who has run the International Monetary Fund for the last eight years. His press conference starts at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
No policy steps are expected after September’s multi-faceted easing program. Instead, the focus is likely to be on the split Draghi created within the bank’s governing council in forcing through a resumption of quantitative easing over the objections of the French, German and Dutch central banks.
The decision to cut the ECB’s deposit rate further into negative territory will also be under scrutiny. Sweden’s Riksbank said earlier Thursday that it expects to end its experiment with negative rates in December, by raising its repo rate back to 0% from -0.25%. That bucks a global trend of monetary easing which is still largely intact: Indonesia cut its key rate again earlier in the day.
2. Tesla's return to profit shines in a misfiring auto sector
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted a surprise return to profit in the third quarter, and CEO Elon Musk said the group’s Model Y crossover SUV will be available sooner than the company had predicted. The shares rose 20% in after-hours trading on Wednesday and are poised to open at an eight-month high.
That was a sharp contrast with Ford Motor (NYSE:F), whose shares fell 2.6% after the bell in response to another cut to its forecasts. Analysts noted that the third-quarter results weren’t actually that bad though.
It’s still a rough year for the global auto sector: Korea’s Hyundai Motor (OTC:HYMLY) missed expectations for its quarterly sales and profits on weak sales in China and higher legal costs.
There was better news from   Daimler   (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz, where revenue rose 8%, while Sweden’s Volvo more than doubled its net profit and reported a 2-percentage point increase in its operating margin.
3. Stocks set for lift from Silicon Valley earnings; Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) 3Q follows after the closing bell 
U.S. stock markets are set to open fractionally higher, as reaction to this quarter’s set of earnings continues to tend to the positive, despite high-profile misses on Wednesday from   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow futures were up 28 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were also up 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4%.
Tech-heavy indexes are due for some support after heavyweight Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) beat expectations for its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. Earnings per share rose to $1.38, well ahead of the $1.24 forecast, as the company raised its guidance for cloud bookings in the current quarter.
Amazon.com heads the roster of companies reporting Thursday, with analysts maybe looking more closely than usual at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services after Microsoft reported slowing growth for its rival service Azure.
4. Global manufacturing is still struggling
The world’s manufacturing sector is still in a funk, according to ‘flash’ purchasing managers indexes from around the world. Japan’s PMI fell the most in three years, and for the fifth month in a row, while Australia’s hit an all-time low of just over 50.
The euro zone, meanwhile, remained stuck near stagnation level, with France’s PMI falling and Germany’s ticking up only modestly from last month’s 10-year low.
The PMI for the U.S. is due out at 9:45 AM ET. Before that, at 8:30, there will be durable goods orders for September and initial jobless claims for last week, while the Kansas City Fed’s regional business survey is due at 11 AM ET. New home sales data are due at 10 AM ET.
Oil holds gains after surprise stock draw
Crude oil prices have held on to most of their gains overnight after a surprise drop in U.S. inventories sparked a vicious short squeeze on Wednesday that drove prices up over 2%.
By 6:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down only 0.6% on the day at $55.66, while international benchmark Brent was down 0.4% at $60.91.
The data snapped a five-week streak of stock builds that had fed fears of a fresh glut on global markets. Speculation is still swirling that the OPEC+ group of producers will announce further cuts to their output when they review their current deal in December. However, comments out of Russia this week suggest they will resist such a move, in the expectation that lower prices will stop the growth in U.S. shale output instead.",0.8971

Other companies expected to report on Thursday include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). 
Nasdaq 100 futures jumped 35 points or 0.5% by 6:53 AM ET (10:53 GMT), while Dow futures rose 18 points or 0.1% and S&P 500 futures were up 3 points or 0.1%. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged 18.5% after a surprise profit from the electric car company, while PayPal was up 8% after a solid third quarter. 
Elsewhere, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) slipped 6.6% after the online marketplace operator cut its sales and earnings outlook for the year, while Ford (NYSE:F) dipped 4.1% after cutting its yearly outlook. 
On the data front,  jobless claims and durable goods come out at 8:30 AM ET and new home sales data is released at 10:00 AM ET.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 23,940.68. The S&P 500 closed 0.04% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 6824.32, down 1.27%.
Stocks came under pressure as a slump in tech stocks weighed on the Nasdaq amid signs that investors were rotating from tech to financials, on expectations that the latter is more sensitive to lower taxes, less regulation and bullish economic growth.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) – the so-called FANG Stocks – closed sharply lower, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) added to gains from Tuesday’s session.
On the economic front, investors cheered data suggesting that the US economy remained on track for a solid final quarter of the year.
Gross domestic product increased at a 3.3% annual rate in the July-September period, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of GDP on Wednesday, beating a previous estimate of 3%.
Meanwhile, positive sentiment on tax reform continued as investors looked ahead to the U.S. Senate floor vote on bill slated for Thursday after the Senate budget committee voted 12-11 in favour of the tax bill on Tuesday.
Signs of progress on the tax reform front comes a little over a week after the US House of Representatives passed its version of tax legislation. For the bill to reach US President Donald Trump’s desk, the two chambers must agree on a final version.

The top performer on the Dow was Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which added 0.96 or 2.19% to 44.62. Coca-Cola finished just above The Travelers Companies Inc (NYSE:TRV), which bounced from lows during Thursday's session when the insurance giant ended the day as the worst stock among the 30 Dow components. On Thursday, Travelers' fell sharply after the company said its profits slumped 17% over the first quarter due primary to a slew of catastrophic storms in Texas over the first three months of the year.
The worst performer was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which tumbled 3.96 or 7.10% to 51.82. It came one day after the Redmond, Washington-based company narrowly missed analysts' quarterly forecasts, amid worse than expected results from its Cloud-based business. With the considerable losses, Microsoft shaved off 25 points from the Dow.
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Endo International PLC (NASDAQ:ENDP), which extended sharp gains from the previous after analysts at JMP Securities initiated coverage in the specialty pharmaceutical company with a favorable rating. Shares in Endo International soared 2.04 or 6.41% to 33.87, building on gains from Thursday when it surged as much as 12%. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also finished as the worst performer on the NASDAQ, just below Alphabet, which plunged 42.10 or 5.40% to 737.90. At one point, Google slipped below its 200-day moving average, while suffering one of its worst days in three years. After the close of trading on Thursday, Google missed analysts' quarterly earnings forecasts amid heavy foreign exchange and equity investment losses.
The top performer on the S&P 500 was Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN), which jumped 1.57 or 14.71% to 12.24. For the week, energy stocks soared by approximately 5%.

Adding pressure to sentiment in China, two local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) announced plans last week to retire their bonds and raise cheaper funds from new bond issues.

U.S. equities pared some of the gains in afternoon trading after Janet Yellen reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates at some point this year. Speaking at a luncheon at The City Club in Cleveland, Yellen downplayed the importance of the Fed's first rate hike in more than a decade, preferring to focus on the gradual pace of policy normalization on a longer-term basis.
""I want to emphasize while there is a lot of public discussion on that first move we should not over emphasize the timing of that first move,"" Yellen said. ""What is really going to matter is the entire path of interest rates over time. My own view is that the headwinds that have been holding back recovery for all these years are receding and conditions are improving.""
While the Dow fell by roughly 15 points following Yellen's comments it still remained up by more than 200 points on the session before rallying even further near the close.

A batch of disappointing quarterly results from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) dragged down the NASDAQ throughout the week, after the trio of tech giants severely missed earnings forecasts. Apple shares continued their descent on Friday, one day after billionaire investor Carl Icahn announced that he was exiting his position  in the world's largest company due to heightened concerns with iPhone growth prospects in China. Consequently, the NASDAQ ended April down by more than 3%.
Adding to investor jitters, consumer confidence  in the U.S. slumped to a 7-month low while Core PCE inflation fell slightly in March, potentially lowering the chances of a June interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. The downbeat data also pushed the dollar to its lowest level since last July, bolstering commodity prices worldwide.
The VIX Volatility jumped more than two points to two-month highs at 17.09, before paring some of the gains late on Friday. For the week, the VIX jumped by more than 11%. Gold, which is viewed as a safe-haven for investors in periods of heightened economic instability, soared more than $25 an ounce to touch 15-month highs.

Earlier on Friday, the energy soft-drink company reported stronger than expected quarterly earnings, reaping the benefits from a comprehensive distribution deal with Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).

In oil markets, a 5.3 million barrel build in U.S. crude inventories caused a knee-jerk sell-off with prices initially extending losses.
Both gasoline and distillate inventories also unexpectedly grew in what was a bearish report from all perspectives.
However, just minutes after the release, Russian energy minister Alexander Novak sent bullish headlines across the wires and oil prices rapidly staged a turnaround.
Novak indicated that they were discussing scenarios to reach an oil market balance in a shorter time period and that he saw a high chance that OPEC would have an agreement in place by November 30.

Also of note, Snapchat was reported to have filed for an initial public offering (IPO) thought to be valued at $20 billion to $25 billion in what would be the largest IPO since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) went public two years ago.
On the economic front, both industrial and manufacturing production missed consensus estimates for an increase in October, dampening optimism over the health of the economy.
Furthermore, producer price inflation in the U.S. came in under forecasts with an unchanged reading in October, while core prices unexpectedly fell, in what would be considered another stumble in the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) intention to get inflation back up towards its 2% target at the start of the fourth quarter.

The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY), which added 3.05 or 3.93% to 80.70 amid strong P/E valuations, which suggests the potential for higher growth in the near future. Shares in Apple also rose 1.20 or 1.26% to 96.42, due in part to increased demand expectations for the company's iPhone 7 brand. During a goodwill tour in India, Apple CEO Tim Cook noted the technology giant will not lower its ""quality bar,"" in response to higher duties and taxes on its products throughout the country.

Monsanto soared 4.94 or 4.87% to close the session as the top performer on the S&P 500.

At a joint appearance in Washington, both Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and San Francisco Fed president John Williams suggested that ""two to three rate hikes,"" seem possible, while Lockhart noted that a rate hike will still remain on the table when the Federal Open Market Committee meets next on June 14-15. After approving its first interest rate hike in seven years at a meeting in December, the FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range of 0.25-0.50% in each of its first three meetings this year. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for equities, as investors look to capitalize on higher yields from U.S. Treasuries and other bonds.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 180.73 or 1.02% to 17,529.98, while the NASDAQ Composite index lost 59.73 or 1.25% to 4,715.73 both closing near session-lows. The S&P 500 Composite index, meanwhile, fell 19.45 or 0.94% to 2,047.21, as nine of 10 sectors closed in the red. Stocks in the Utilities, Consumer Goods and Consumer Services lagged, each falling by more than 1% on the session. Stocks in the energy industry, the lone sector to post positive gains on the day, led on Tuesday. The S&P remains near a key technical level at 2,043.
The top performer on the Dow was  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), which gained 0.35 or 0.50% to 71.05. It came as gold futures ticked higher on Tuesday remaining near 15-month highs, as billionaire investor George Soros disclosed a $385 million stake in the precious metal. Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment manufacturer, is sensitive to any changes in metal prices.
The worst performer was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which fell 1.32 or 2.55% to 50.51. Microsoft closed just below  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), which lost 3.34 or 2.47% to 132.00, in spite of reporting upbeat earnings and strong full-year guidance on Tuesday. While Home Depot (NYSE:HD)'s comparative store sales increased by 7.4% for the quarter, their comps decelerated in all three months of the period. After surging 10.2% in February, Home Depot's same-store sales rose by 4.3% in April, a key sales period for the home improvement company.
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Endo International PLC (NASDAQ:ENDP), which surged 0.87 or 6.08% to 15.17. Shares in the specialty drug maker are up by more than 11% since falling to 52-week lows last week, amid widespread pricing concerns. The worst performer was Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC), which fell 3.71 or 4.32% to 82.16. Shares in the major food company are virtually flat since their merger last year.
The top performer on the S&P 500 was Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN), which added 0.80 or 6.98% to 12.26. Despite the rally in global energy prices, shares in Southwestern Energy are still down by more than 55% over the last 52 weeks. The worst performer was  Kimco Realty  Corporation (NYSE:KIM), which declined 1.19 or 4.09% to 27.93. Shares in the New York-based Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) tumbled amid reports from FINRA that total short interest in Kimco increased to 10.47 million, up by 6.13% from its last report.

The NYSE halted trading of all securities at 11:32 a.m. as officials cancelled all open orders at the time of the suspension. As officials worked feverishly to correct the network malfunction, the world's largest stock exchange took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to allay any concerns that the delay stemmed from a comprehensive cyber breach. At the time of the halt, stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down roughly 218 points on the session.
""Around mid-morning we started to see some concerns about the way trading was occurring, customers weren't getting all the messages back that you would otherwise expect,"" New York Stock Exchange president Tom Farley told CNBC. ""It was a technical error, it looks like a configuration problem.""
The suspension came hours after thousands of United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) passengers were grounded on Wednesday morning, when the major U.S. airlines carrier suffered a separate technical breakdown. An issue with a router degraded network connectivity for the airlines' various applications, causing an operational disruption, a United Airlines spokesperson said in a statement. Officials from The White House, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission quickly confirmed that the disruptions were unrelated and were not caused by a cyber breach.
Minutes before trading on the NYSE resumed at 3:10 EST, the Dow was down 232.04 or 1.31%, above session-lows of approximately 270 points during the outage. Trading of NYSE securities on other platforms continued while the exchange remained closed. For the session, the NASDAQ Composite index and S&P 500 Composite were also each down by more than 1.3% in the minutes before NYSE trading resumed.
After a modest rally when the NYSE reopened, the major indices closed slightly lower amid a late sell-off. The Dow closed down 261.49 or 1.47% to 17,515.42, while the NASDAQ lost 87.70 or 1.75% to 4,909.76.
The S&P 500, meanwhile, fell 34.65 or 1.66% to 2,046.69, as stocks in all 10 sectors closed in the red. Stocks in the Basic Materials, Energy and Telecommunication industries lagged, each falling by more than 2% on the session.
All 30 components on the Dow closed the session in the red. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended the session as its top performer, even after losing 0.06 or 0.14% to 44.24. The worst performer was Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which plunged 3.12 or 2.48% to 122.57.
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC), which rose 0.03 or 0.13 to 22.82. The worst performer on the NASDAQ was Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), which tumbled 7.21 or 6.48% to 104.14.
On the S&P 500,  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) finished as the top performer after gaining 0.89 or 1.17% to 77.05. The worst performer was Delphi Automotive, which fell 5.81 or 6.91% to 78.23.
Meanwhile, yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries fell slightly by two basis points to 2.201%, less than an hour after the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its June FOMC meeting. While the FOMC appeared to take a relatively dovish position on the timing of its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade, one Fed governor voted in favor of a June lift-off. Earlier, yields reached an intraday high of 2.256% ahead of the release.
Volatility in the Chinese economy continued to weigh, as the Shanghai Composite Index plunged 5.9% to 3,507.19. In total, trading was halted on more than 1,330 companies during the session following further efforts from the People's Bank of China to stimulate Chinese equities markets. Over the last month, Chinese stocks have plunged roughly 30% amid the slowest economic growth in the nation in more than a decade.",-0.8555

At 15:49GMT or 11:49AM ET, the Dow 30 inched up 13 points, or 0.07%, while the S&P 500 edged forward 2 points, or 0.08%, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite slipped 2 points, or 0.047%.
While personal spending inched up by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, matching expectations, the increase for January was revised down to a paltry gain of 0.1% from a previously reported rise of 0.5%.
Personal income, for its part, rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, above forecasts for a 0.1% gain and after rising 0.5% a month earlier.
The meager increase in personal outlays last month, coupled with the prior month’s downward revision, prompted the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta to slash its forecast for U.S. GDP growth in the first quarter to 0.6%, from the prior estimate of 1.4%.
As the Atlanta Fed explained, the forecast for real consumer spending growth in the first quarter was reduced to 1.8%, from the prior 2.5%, due to the report from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
The core PCE price index inched up 0.1% last month, below expectations for a gain of 0.2% and after rising 0.3% in January, while the core PCE price index rose at an annualized rate of 1.7%, missing estimates for 1.8% and after a 1.7% gain a month earlier.
The core PCE readings are often considered to be the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation and the lack of movement may support the dovish argument for the U.S. central bank to hold off on the path of policy tightening.
Indeed, the dollar showed weakness after the data with the US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, slipping 0.30% to 95.88.
In more positive economic data, pending home sales in the U.S. bounced back in February from the prior month’s decline, reaching a seven month high. The 3.5% increase handily beat consensus expectations for a gain of just 1.0%.
Meanwhile, oil prices were unable to maintain gains and lost around 1% on Monday despite data released last Thursday (prior to the long holiday weekend) from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes showing that the the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. fell by 15 last week to 372.
Experts continue to be wary that a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers on April 17 will be able to achieve a meaningful impact to reduce the global supply glut with some market watchers going so far as to doubt if the meeting will even take place.
Furthermore,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) warned on Monday about the recent rally and suggested that an unwinding of long positions could push oil back down to near $30.
Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost 0.63% to $39.21 a barrel by 15:50GMT or 11:50AM ET, while Brent oil fell 0.85% to $40.68.
In company news, Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) rose just 0.4% after it was reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) executives were in talks with other potential investors to buy the internet portal.
 Avon Products  Inc (NYSE:AVP) gained almost 8% after the cosmetics maker announced an agreement to avoid a proxy fight.
China’s Angang Insurance Group raised its offer for  Starwood Hotels  & Resorts Worldwide (NYSE:HOT) to challenge the merger with Marriot International (NASDAQ:MAR).
 Cal-Maine Foods  Inc (NASDAQ:CALM) shot up almost 7% after reporting a 26% increase in profit, easily beating Wall Street estimates.

Stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ Composite index plunged more than 0.4%, while nearly all 10 sectors of the S&P 500 Composite Index closed in the red on a bearish opening to the week. The Dow lost 107.67 or 0.60% to 17,791.17 to fall into negative territory for the year, while the NASDAQ dipped 21.13 or 0.42% to 5,029.97, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other prominent tech stocks weighed.

On Monday, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) acquired  Target  Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) pharmacy and clinic arm in a $1.9 billion that will spread the Rhode Island-based pharmacy chain's imprint on an additional 1,700 locations throughout the U.S. The deal comes weeks after CVS' acquisition of Omnicare in a merger valued at more than $10 billion. Shares in CVS gained 0.35 or 0.35% to 102.58, while shares in Target rose 0.97 or 1.22% to 80.45.
Also on Monday, shares in Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) surged to a record-high $162.16 amid multiple reports that the Connecticut-based managed health care insurer rebuffed a takeover bid from rival Anthem. At one point, Cigna shares surged more than 17% on the session before falling slightly back to 154.40. Cigna, which gained 17.09 or 12.45% on the session, finished as the top performer on the S&P 500.
The merger rumors also impacted UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which soared 1.49 or 1.27% to 119.14. UnitedHealth ended Monday's session as the top performer on the Dow. The worst performer was United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX), which fell 2.84 or 2.41% to 114.76 after the multi-national conglomerate announced that it will divest its Sikorsky Helicopter division either in a sale or a spin-off. The move had been expected after United Technologies announced that it could unload the helicopter division in March.
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:ALXN), which rose 4.02 or 2.38% to 173.06. Last month, Alexion Pharmaceuticals acquired Synageva in an $8.4 billion merger. The worst performer was Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), which fell roughly 1% to a 14-month low at 23.70, after receiving a downgrade from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

On the S&P 500, Cigna finished just ahead of  First Solar Inc  (NASDAQ:FSLR), which gained 2.94 or 5.82% to 53.42. The worst performer on the S&P was PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG), which closed at 115.47, after its board executed a 2-for-1 stock split.

The Dow lost 217.23 or 1.21% to 17,711.12, while the NASDAQ Composite index fell 49.19 or 1.02% to 4,760.69, halting a three-day winning streak.

Macy's, one of the largest retailers in the U.S., dragged down the major indices after missing first quarter sales forecasts and slashing full-year revenue expectations on Wednesday. At one point in the session, Macy's tumbled to 52-week lows erasing all of their gains year to date. It came as the company's same-store sales, a closely-watched industry metric, declined for the fifth straight quarter. The subdued quarter from Macy's raised fresh questions about the viability of brick-and-mortar stores, as consumer continue to flock to major e-commerce websites to handle a bulk of their shopping needs. As a result, the SPDR Retail ETF suffered its worst one-day loss since 2011. Shares in  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) both fell by more than 5%, while JC Penney Company Inc Holding (NYSE:JCP) shares lost 0.21 or 2.53% to 7.89.

Disney finished as the worst performer, losing 4.31 or 4.04% to 102.29, shaving off approximately 30 points on the Dow. On Tuesday after the bell, Disney posted a rare earnings miss amid softer consumer product sales and relative advertising weakness at ESPN. Meanwhile, investors remained concerned about future pricing structures at ESPN as the prospects for Pay TV bundles continues to evolve.
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA), which surged 8.75 or 13.56% to 73.29 in the wake of stellar earnings and revenues during its last quarter. For the first quarter of 2016, Electronic Arts saw its adjusted revenue jumped 3.1% driven by strong sales among its Star Wars Battlefront and sports video games. The worst performer was Endo International, which tumbled 1.84 or 11.86% to 13.68.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ Composite index and the S&P 500 Composite index all dropped by at least 0.4%, as a late rally spared U.S. stocks from reaching its biggest two-day sell-off since late-January. The Dow lost 86.22 or 0.48% to 17,841.98, nearly dropping into negative territory for the year, while the NASDAQ fell 19.69 or 0.40% to 4,919.64, as it continued to retreat from near-record highs from early last week.

Speaking at an appearance at the Institute for New Economic Thinking's Finance and Society Conference, Yellen sounded off on the current state of global bond and equities markets. Responding to a question posed by IMF head Christine Lagarde, Yellen indicated that while the Fed is somewhat concerned about financial stability in the equity markets, it is not worried about potential bubbles forming.
""I would highlight that equity market valuations at this point generally are quite high,"" Yellen said. ""There are potential dangers there.""
On the Dow, all but four of its 30 components closed lower on Wednesday following Yellen's comments.
