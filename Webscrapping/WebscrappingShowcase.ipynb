       " ['(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA)\\'s first direct delivery of a 787 Dreamliner to China since 2019 is set to land in Shanghai on Friday, a step that could hasten the end of China\\'s freeze on deliveries of the firm\\'s profitable 737 MAX after more than four years. Privately owned Chinese carrier Juneyao Airlines on Thursday took delivery of the 787-9 aircraft, which Boeing said then departed for China from Everett Paine Field in Washington state.  The flight is set to land in Shanghai around 3:30 p.m. local time (0730 GMT), the airline said. China suspended most orders and deliveries of Boeing planes in 2019 after the 737 MAX was grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes. A restart of MAX deliveries would represent a reset of Boeing\\'s relationship with China and create an opportunity for the company to offload dozens of planes in its inventory, and pave the way for a larger breakthrough in deliveries and orders. The company expects China to account for 20% of the world\\'s aircraft demands through to 2042. Boeing last delivered a leased Dreamliner plane to a Chinese customer in 2021, but no 787s have been handed over directly to Chinese airlines since November 2019. Analysts had forecast the resumption of Dreamliner deliveries to China after consultancy AAP/AIR this month reported preparatory flight activities for a 787 designated for Juneyao Airlines, registered as B-20EQ. Twelve of the 60 undelivered 787s in Boeing\\'s inventory are dedicated for Chinese operators, analysts Jefferies said. Boeing\\'s business with Chinese airlines could be affected by the political ties between Washington and Beijing, which have recently improved.  Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first face-to-face talks in a year, and on Thursday the top U.S. military officer spoke to his Chinese counterpart in the first such conversation in over a year. MAX PROGRESS On Wednesday, trade publication The Air Current said Boeing had this month won a key clearance from regulator the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) allowing the planemaker to prepare MAX aircraft for delivery. The safety bans have been lifted as existing MAX planes are flying inside China, but new deliveries have remained on hold. The CAAC\\'s deputy head on Dec. 8 told a Boeing executive in Beijing the planemaker was welcome to deepen its development in the Chinese market, Reuters reported. The Air Current, citing unidentified sources, said the regulator\\'s clearance was granted that day. Individual MAX deliveries to China still need approval from China\\'s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Air Current report said. Boeing told Reuters it is ready to deliver to customers \"when that time comes\". The CAAC and NDRC did not respond to requests for comment. A 737 MAX designated for China Southern Airlines flew from Boeing Field in Seattle to Boeing\\'s nearby facility in Moses Lake, Washington, and back on Wednesday afternoon, according to data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24. \\nAnalysts from Jefferies and Deutsche Bank said in investor notes that it appeared to be a customer acceptance flight - a test flight operated by an airline pilot that occurs before delivery. MAX deliveries to China could provide some upside to Boeing\\'s $10 billion free cash flow target for 2025-2026, as that projection did not factor in potential deliveries to China, analysts say.',\n",

The writers, including Pulitzer Prize winners Taylor Branch, Stacy Schiff and Kai Bird - who co-wrote the J. Robert Oppenheimer biography \"American Prometheus\" that was adapted into the hit film \"Oppenheimer\" this year - told the court on Tuesday that the companies infringed their copyrights by using their work to train OpenAI\\'s GPT large language models. Representatives for OpenAI and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. \"The defendants are raking in billions from their unauthorized use of nonfiction books, and the authors of these books deserve fair compensation and treatment for it,\" the writers\\' attorney Rohit Nath said on Wednesday. Writer and Hollywood Reporter editor Julian Sancton first filed the proposed class-action lawsuit last month. The case is one of several that have been brought by groups of copyright owners including authors John Grisham, George R.R. Martin and Jonathan Franzen against OpenAI and other tech companies over the alleged misuse of their work in AI training.  The companies have denied the allegations. Sancton\\'s was the first author lawsuit against OpenAI to also name Microsoft as a defendant. The tech giant has invested billions of dollars in the artificial intelligence startup and integrated OpenAI\\'s systems into its products. The amended complaint filed on Monday said that OpenAI \"scraped\" the authors\\' works along with reams of other copyrighted material from the internet without permission to teach its GPT models how to respond to human text prompts. \\nThe lawsuit also said that Microsoft has been \"deeply involved\" in training and developing the models and is also liable for copyright infringement. The authors asked the court for an unspecified amount of monetary damages and an order for the companies to stop infringing their copyrights.',\n",

Microsoft uses mixed reality to describe software that blends both augmented and virtual reality. Augmented reality overlays text, sounds, graphics and video on real-world images that users see in front of them, while virtual reality immerses the users in an artificial world by creating computer-generated experiences. \\n\"Windows mixed reality is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Windows,\" Microsoft said.

The electronic waste from these PCs could weigh an estimated 480 million kilograms, equivalent to 320,000 cars.  While many PCs could remain functional for years post the end of OS support, Canalys warned demand for devices without security updates could be low. Microsoft announced a plan to provide security updates for Windows 10 devices until October 2028 for an undisclosed annual price. If the pricing structure for extended Windows 10 support mirrors past trends, migrating to newer PCs could be more cost-effective, increasing the number of older PCs heading to scrap, Canalys said. Microsoft aims to discontinue support for Windows 10 by October 2025. The next generation of the OS, anticipated to bring advanced artificial intelligence technology to PCs, could potentially boost the sluggish PC market. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the environmental impact of disposal of Windows 11-incompatible devices. Hard drives used in personal computers and data storage servers are recycled to gather materials for use in electric vehicle motors and even renewable power generation. \"Turning end-of-life computers into the magnets that power sustainable technologies like electric vehicles and wind turbines will help meet the rising global demand for electricity,\" said Noveon Magnetics Chief Commercial Officer Peter Afiuny. \\nAfiuny added hard drives are often discarded before they reach the end of their functional lifespan, creating an excess of rare earth magnetic material waste.

       " ['Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is up almost 2% today after the board announced the approval of a $40 billion stock buyback program and an 11% dividend increase. Microsoft is the most cash (& cash equivalent) rich company in the market and has been buying back its own stock for almost a decade.\\nStock buybacks are hitting record highs as companies with excessive amounts of cash on hand want to keep shareholders happy with short-term share appreciation. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) , Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) , and Microsoft rank amongst the largest stock repurchasers of 2019 so far.\\n\\nThrough the first half of the year, Apple bought back $42 billion in its shares, while Oracle repurchased $16.3 billion, and Microsoft purchased over $9 billion in its own shares. 2018 marked an all-time high for stock repurchases with a market total of over $800 billion stock buybacks.\\nAAPL has bought back roughly a quarter trillion dollars’ worth of its own stock over the past 5-years, while Oracle and Microsoft come in at over $70 billion in the same time frame.\\nThese are some of the most cash rich companies in the world, but are they putting their cash to good use?\\nProductive Use of Money\\nAre share buybacks the most productive use of funds for producing long term shareholder returns? There are a few sides to this coin and they are very circumstantial. There are three things that a company can do with the cash on their balance sheet, one is let it sit in some low interest earning account, be used as commercial paper, or be put in some other fixed income vehicle. This will have very little effect on a stock price because this is what is expected from a cash pile on a company’s balance sheet.\\nThe next thing that a company can do with extra cash is to invest in either organic developments like R&D or sales & marketing, or in a productive acquisition (full or partial). Cash used in this manner is typically the most advantageous for all stakeholders, as long as the investments have robust ROIs (return on investment). In an environment where valuations are high, acquisitions and R&D are more expensive than the projected returns. This avenue would not be the most productive use of cash.\\nThe final use of cash that I will discuss is giving it directly back to the shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This use of capital will boost short-term share prices, but will it have a long-term positive effect for shareholders? A consistent dividend is a sign that a company has matured and expects a reliable stream of income moving forward. Dividends are good for a stock stability if the firm is able to maintain its dividend yield.\\nStock repurchase programs will have the same short-term stock price boost as an additional dividend, but the difference is that it is not typically consistent and will only create shareholder value if the shares bought are undervalued. Buying back stock when the intrinsic worth of the stock is below its current price will deteriorate shareholder value.\\nBack to Microsoft \\nMicrosoft is trading at its all-time high right now and its forward P/E has been surging over the last 5 years as investors become more excited about Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure. Should Microsoft be buying back its own relatively expensive stock, or should the company be investing more in its cloud platform? The firm could be using the cash to further consolidate the cloud market through savvy acquisition of small cloud firms.\\nLike I said, high valuations make acquisitions a less attractive play and valuations in the tech industry are slightly high currently. There is only so much money that a company can poor into its R&D department before they start losing marginal value.\\nThough, buying stock back at all-time highs doesn’t look great for long term shareholder value, especially when its forward P/E is the highest its been in over a decade.\\nTake Away\\nI am not a big fan of companies throwing their extra cash back at the shareholders when there is still a substantial amount of growth potential. In my opinion, these tech stocks should be focusing on advancing technology and in turn humanity, instead of being worried about short-term share price boosts.\\nStocks like AAPL and ORCL have shown little to no top or bottom-line growth this year but their stock price still seems to appreciate. This is primarily due to their stock buyback programs. Some of these tech companies use buybacks as merely a way to preserve their stock’s attractiveness.\\nThere is a time and place where stock buybacks are appropriate such as when the stock price is undervalued and there are no more productive uses for the money, but this can still be speculative.\\n \\n 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020.
