    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Troy Mazerolle, and I am a University of Waterloo graduate holding a Bachelor's Degree in Economics with a specialization in Econometrics and a minor degree in Mathematics. Currently, I am advancing my expertise by pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Applied Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Conestoga College, with a planned four-month co-op term commencing in May 2024. I am actively seeking a placement for this co-op term to apply and enhance my academic foundation in a practical setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a dynamic and results-driven data science enthusiast with a solid academic background in Artificial Intelligence and Econometrics, and hands-on experience in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. I am seeking a challenging role in data science or actuarial science where I can leverage my analytical skills, programming proficiency in Python and R, and passion for transforming complex data sets into actionable insights. I am eager to contribute to a dynamic team to apply cutting-edge data science techniques to problems and drive impactful solutions in a collaborative and innovative environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to my regular studies next semester, I will also be studying for the actuarial exam P and exam FM tests so that by May I will have two actuarial exams completed.  While I am open to more than actuarial positions, I am taking the exams because I believe that going through the actuarial qualification process will help inform my statistical and risk management decision making, regardless if I end up with an actuarial posiition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are more details that speak to my qualifications and abilities. Under **Job Information** you can find my resumé and transcripts, and under **Portfolio** you can find some examples of projects that I have completed and which areas of expertise each project demonstrates."
